\rSec1[lex.phases]{Phases of translation}%

\pnum
\indextext{translation!phases|(}
The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the
following phases.\footnote{Implementations must behave as if these separate phases
occur, although in practice different phases might be folded together.}

\begin{enumerate}
\indextext{source file}%
\indextext{character!source file}%
\indextext{character set!basic source}%
\item Physical source file characters are mapped, in an
\impldef{mapping physical source file characters to basic source character set} manner,
to the basic source character set (introducing new-line characters for end-of-line
indicators) if necessary.
The set of physical source file characters accepted is \impldef{physical source file
characters}.
\indextext{trigraph sequence}Trigraph sequences~(\ref{lex.trigraph}) are
replaced by corresponding single-character internal representations. Any
source file character not in the basic source character
set~(\ref{lex.charset}) is replaced by the
\indextext{universal character name}universal-character-name that
designates that character. (An implementation may use any internal
encoding, so long as an actual extended character encountered in the
source file, and the same extended character expressed in the source
file as a universal-character-name (i.e., using the \tcode{\textbackslash
uXXXX} notation), are handled equivalently
except where this replacement is reverted in a raw string literal.)

\indextext{line splicing}%
\item Each instance of a backslash character (\textbackslash)
immediately followed by a new-line character is deleted, splicing
physical source lines to form logical source lines. Only the last
backslash on any physical source line shall be eligible for being part
of such a splice. If, as a result, a character sequence that matches the
syntax of a universal-character-name is produced, the behavior is
undefined. A source file that is not empty and that does not end in a new-line
character, or that ends in a new-line character immediately preceded by a
backslash character before any such splicing takes place,
shall be processed as if an additional new-line character were appended
to the file.

\item The source file is decomposed into preprocessing
tokens~(\ref{lex.pptoken}) and sequences of white-space characters
(including comments). A source file shall not end in a partial
preprocessing token or in a partial comment.\footnote{A partial preprocessing
token would arise from a source file
ending in the first portion of a multi-character token that requires a
terminating sequence of characters, such as a \grammarterm{header-name}
that is missing the closing \tcode{"}
or \tcode{>}. A partial comment
would arise from a source file ending with an unclosed \tcode{/*}
comment.}
Each comment is replaced by one space character. New-line characters are
retained. Whether each nonempty sequence of white-space characters other
than new-line is retained or replaced by one space character is
unspecified. The process of dividing a source file's
characters into preprocessing tokens is context-dependent.
\enterexample
see the handling of \tcode{<} within a \tcode{\#include} preprocessing
directive.
\exitexample

\item Preprocessing directives are executed, macro invocations are
expanded, and \tcode{_Pragma} unary operator expressions are executed.
If a character sequence that matches the syntax of a
universal-character-name is produced by token
concatenation~(\ref{cpp.concat}), the behavior is undefined. A
\tcode{\#include} preprocessing directive causes the named header or
source file to be processed from phase 1 through phase 4, recursively.
All preprocessing directives are then deleted.

\item Each source character set member in a character literal or a string
literal, as well as each escape sequence and universal-character-name in a
character literal or a non-raw string literal, is converted to the corresponding
member of the execution character set~(\ref{lex.ccon}, \ref{lex.string}); if
there is no corresponding member, it is converted to an \impldef{converting
characters from source character set to execution character set} member other
than the null (wide) character.\footnote{An implementation need not convert all
non-corresponding source characters to the same execution character.}

\item Adjacent string literal tokens are concatenated.

\item White-space characters separating tokens are no longer
significant. Each preprocessing token is converted into a
token.~(\ref{lex.token}). The resulting tokens are syntactically and
semantically analyzed and translated as a translation unit. \enternote
The process of analyzing and translating the tokens may occasionally
result in one token being replaced by a sequence of other
tokens~(\ref{temp.names}).\exitnote \enternote Source files, translation
units and translated translation units need not necessarily be stored as
files, nor need there be any one-to-one correspondence between these
entities and any external representation. The description is conceptual
only, and does not specify any particular implementation. \exitnote

\item Translated translation units and instantiation units are combined
as follows: \enternote Some or all of these may be supplied from a
library. \exitnote Each translated translation unit is examined to
produce a list of required instantiations. \enternote This may include
instantiations which have been explicitly
requested~(\ref{temp.explicit}). \exitnote The definitions of the
required templates are located. It is \impldef{whether source of translation units must
be available to locate template definitions} whether the
source of the translation units containing these definitions is required
to be available. \enternote An implementation could encode sufficient
information into the translated translation unit so as to ensure the
source is not required here. \exitnote All the required instantiations
are performed to produce
\defn{instantiation units}. \enternote These are similar
to translated translation units, but contain no references to
uninstantiated templates and no template definitions. \exitnote The
program is ill-formed if any instantiation fails.

\item All external entity references are resolved. Library
components are linked to satisfy external references to
entities not defined in the current translation. All such translator
output is collected into a program image which contains information
needed for execution in its execution environment.%

Each preprocessing token that is converted to a token~(\ref{lex.token})

\pnum
A preprocessing token is the minimal lexical element of the language in translation
phases 3 through 6. The categories of preprocessing token are: header names,
identifiers, preprocessing numbers, character literals (including user-defined character
literals), string literals (including user-defined string literals), preprocessing
operators and punctuators, and single non-white-space characters that do not lexically
match the other preprocessing token categories. If a \tcode{'} or a \tcode{"} character
matches the last category, the behavior is undefined. Preprocessing tokens can be
separated by
\indextext{space!white}%
white space;
\indextext{comment}%
this consists of comments~(\ref{lex.comment}), or white-space
characters (space, horizontal tab, new-line, vertical tab, and
form-feed), or both. As described in Clause~\ref{cpp}, in certain
circumstances during translation phase 4, white space (or the absence
thereof) serves as more than preprocessing token separation. White space
can appear within a preprocessing token only as part of a header name or
between the quotation characters in a character literal or string
literal.

\pnum
If the input stream has been parsed into preprocessing tokens up to a
given character:

\begin{itemize}
\item If the next character begins a sequence of characters that could be the prefix
and initial double quote of a raw string literal, such as \tcode{R"}, the next preprocessing
token shall be a raw string literal. Between the initial and final
double quote characters of the raw string, any transformations performed in phases
1 and 2 (trigraphs, universal-character-names, and line splicing) are reverted; this reversion
shall apply before any \grammarterm{d-char}, \grammarterm{r-char}, or delimiting
parenthesis is identified. The raw string literal is defined as the shortest sequence
of characters that matches the raw-string pattern

\begin{ncbnf}
encoding-prefix\opt \terminal{R} raw-string
\end{ncbnf}

\item Otherwise, if the next three characters are \tcode{<::} and the subsequent character
is neither \tcode{:} nor \tcode{>}, the \tcode{<} is treated as a preprocessor token by
itself and not as the first character of the alternative token \tcode{<:}.

the next preprocessing token is the longest sequence of
characters that could constitute a preprocessing token, even if that
would cause further lexical analysis to fail.

An \term{integer literal} is a sequence of digits that has no period
or exponent part. An integer literal may have a prefix that specifies
its base and a suffix that specifies its type. The lexically first digit
of the sequence of digits is the most significant. A \term{decimal}
integer literal (base ten) begins with a digit other than \tcode{0} and
consists of a sequence of decimal digits. An \term{octal} integer
literal (base eight) begins with the digit \tcode{0} and consists of a
sequence of octal digits.\footnote{The digits \tcode{8} and \tcode{9} are not octal digits. }
A \term{hexadecimal} integer literal (base sixteen) begins with
\tcode{0x} or \tcode{0X} and consists of a sequence of hexadecimal
digits, which include the decimal digits and the letters \tcode{a}
through \tcode{f} and \tcode{A} through \tcode{F} with decimal values
ten through fifteen. \enterexample the number twelve can be written
\tcode{12}, \tcode{014}, or \tcode{0XC}. \exitexample

A floating literal consists of an integer part, a decimal point, a
fraction part, an
\indextext{suffix!\idxcode{e}}%
\indextext{suffix!\idxcode{E}}%
\tcode{e} or \tcode{E}, an optionally signed integer exponent, and an
optional type suffix. The integer and fraction parts both consist of a
sequence of decimal (base ten) digits. Either the integer part or the
fraction part (not both) can be omitted; either the decimal point or the
letter \tcode{e} (or \tcode{E} ) and the exponent (not both) can be
omitted. The integer part, the optional decimal point and the optional
fraction part form the \term{significant part} of the
floating literal. The exponent, if present, indicates the power of 10 by
which the significant part is to be scaled. If the scaled value is in
the range of representable values for its type, the result is the scaled
value if representable, else the larger or smaller representable value
nearest the scaled value, chosen in an \impldef{choice of larger or smaller value of
floating literal} manner.

In translation phase 6~(\ref{lex.phases}), adjacent string literals are concatenated. If
both string literals have the same \grammarterm{encoding-prefix}, the resulting concatenated string literal has

the same \grammarterm{encoding-prefix} as the other operand. If a UTF-8 string literal token is adjacent to a
wide string literal token, the program is ill-formed. Any other concatenations are
conditionally supported with \impldef{concatenation of some types of string literals}
behavior. \enternote This
concatenation is an interpretation, not a conversion.
Because the interpretation happens in translation phase 6 (after each character from a
literal has been translated into a value from the appropriate character set), a string
literal's initial rawness has no effect on the interpretation or well-formedness of the
concatenation.
