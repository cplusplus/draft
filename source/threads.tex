\rSec0[thread]{Thread support library}

\rSec1[thread.general]{General}

\pnum
The following subclauses describe components to create and manage
threads\iref{intro.multithread}, perform mutual exclusion, and communicate conditions
and values
between threads, as summarized in \tref{thread.summary}.

\begin{libsumtab}{Thread support library summary}{thread.summary}

\rSec1[thread.req]{Requirements}

\rSec2[thread.req.paramname]{Template parameter names}

\pnum
Throughout this Clause, the names of template parameters are used to express type
requirements.
If a template parameter is named \tcode{Predicate}, \tcode{operator()} applied to
the template argument shall return a value that is convertible to \tcode{bool}.
If a template parameter is named \tcode{Clock},
the corresponding template argument shall be a type \tcode{C}
that meets the \oldconcept{Clock} requirements\iref{time.clock.req};
the program is ill-formed if \tcode{is_clock_v<C>} is \tcode{false}.

\rSec2[thread.req.exception]{Exceptions}

\pnum
Some functions described in this Clause are specified to throw exceptions of type
\tcode{system_error}\iref{syserr.syserr}. Such exceptions are thrown if
any of the function's error conditions is detected or
a call to
an operating system or other underlying API results in an error that prevents the
library function from
meeting its specifications. Failure to allocate storage is reported as described
in~\ref{res.on.exception.handling}.

\begin{example}
Consider a function in this Clause that is specified to throw exceptions of type
\tcode{system_error} and specifies error conditions that include
\tcode{operation_not_permitted} for a thread that does not have the privilege to
perform the operation. Assume that, during the execution of this function, an \tcode{errno}
of \tcode{EPERM} is reported by a POSIX API call used by the implementation. Since POSIX
specifies an \tcode{errno} of \tcode{EPERM} when ``the caller does not have the privilege
to perform the operation'', the implementation maps \tcode{EPERM} to an
\tcode{error_condition} of \tcode{operation_not_permitted}\iref{syserr} and an exception
of type \tcode{system_error} is thrown.
\end{example}

\pnum
The \tcode{error_code} reported by such an exception's \tcode{code()} member function
compares equal to one of the conditions specified in the function's error condition
element.

\rSec2[thread.req.native]{Native handles}

\pnum
Several classes described in this Clause have members \tcode{native_handle_type} and
\tcode{native_handle}. The presence of these members and their semantics is
\impldef{presence and meaning of \tcode{native_handle_type} and \tcode{native_handle}}.
\begin{note}
These members allow implementations to provide access
to implementation details. Their names are specified to facilitate portable compile-time
detection. Actual use of these members is inherently non-portable.
\end{note}

\rSec2[thread.req.timing]{Timing specifications}

\pnum
Several functions described in this Clause take an argument to specify a timeout. These
timeouts are specified as either a \tcode{duration} or a \tcode{time_point} type as
specified in~\ref{time}.

\pnum
Implementations necessarily have some delay in returning from a timeout. Any overhead in
interrupt response, function return, and scheduling induces a ``quality of implementation''
delay, expressed as duration $D_i$. Ideally, this delay would be zero. Further, any contention for
processor and memory resources induces a ``quality of management'' delay, expressed as duration
$D_m$. The delay durations may vary from timeout to timeout, but in all cases shorter is better.

\pnum
The functions whose names end in \tcode{_for} take an argument that
specifies a duration. These functions produce relative timeouts. Implementations
should use a steady clock to measure time for these functions.
\begin{footnote}
Implementations for which standard time units are meaningful will typically
have a steady clock within their hardware implementation.
\end{footnote}
Given a duration
argument $D_t$, the real-time duration of the timeout is $D_t + D_i + D_m$.

\pnum
The functions whose names end in \tcode{_until} take an argument that specifies a time
point. These functions produce absolute timeouts. Implementations should use the clock
specified in the time point to measure time for these functions. Given a clock time point
argument $C_t$, the clock time point of the return from timeout should be $C_t + D_i + D_m$
when the clock is not adjusted during the timeout. If the clock is adjusted to the time $C_a$
during the timeout, the behavior should be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
If $C_a > C_t$, the waiting function should wake as soon as possible, i.e., $C_a + D_i + D_m$,
since the timeout is already satisfied.
This specification may result in the total
duration of the wait decreasing when measured against a steady clock.

\item
If $C_a \leq C_t$, the waiting function should not time out until \tcode{Clock::now()} returns a
time $C_n \geq C_t$, i.e., waking at $C_t + D_i + D_m$.
\begin{note}
When the clock is adjusted
backwards, this specification can result in the total duration of the wait increasing when
measured against a steady clock. When the clock is adjusted forwards, this specification can
result in the total duration of the wait decreasing when measured against a steady clock.
\end{note}
\end{itemize}

An implementation returns from such a timeout at any point from the time specified above to
the time it would return from a steady-clock relative timeout on the difference between $C_t$
and the time point of the call to the \tcode{_until} function.

\recommended
Implementations
should decrease the duration of the wait when the clock is adjusted forwards.

\pnum
\begin{note}
If the clock is not synchronized with a steady clock, e.g., a CPU time clock, these
timeouts can fail to provide useful functionality.
\end{note}

\pnum
The resolution of timing provided by an implementation depends on both operating system
and hardware. The finest resolution provided by an implementation is called the
\term{native resolution}.

\pnum
Implementation-provided clocks that are used for these functions meet the
\oldconcept{TrivialClock} requirements\iref{time.clock.req}.

\pnum
A function that takes an argument which specifies a timeout will throw if,
during its execution, a clock, time point, or time duration throws an exception.
Such exceptions are referred to as \term{timeout-related exceptions}.
\begin{note}
Instantiations of clock, time point and duration types supplied by
the implementation as specified in~\ref{time.clock} do not throw exceptions.
\end{note}

\rSec2[thread.req.lockable]{Requirements for \oldconcept{Lockable} types}

\rSec3[thread.req.lockable.general]{In general}

\pnum
An \defn{execution agent} is an entity such as a thread that may perform work in parallel with
other execution agents.
\begin{note}
Implementations or users can introduce other kinds of
agents such as processes or thread-pool tasks.
\end{note}
The calling agent is determined by
context, e.g., the calling thread that contains the call, and so on.

\pnum
\begin{note}
Some lockable objects are ``agent oblivious'' in that they work for any
execution agent model because they do not determine or store the agent's ID (e.g., an
ordinary spin lock).
\end{note}

\pnum
The standard library templates \tcode{unique_lock}\iref{thread.lock.unique},
\tcode{shared_lock}\iref{thread.lock.shared},
\tcode{scoped_lock}\iref{thread.lock.scoped},
\tcode{lock_guard}\iref{thread.lock.guard}, \tcode{lock},
\tcode{try_lock}\iref{thread.lock.algorithm}, and
\tcode{condition_variable_any}\iref{thread.condition.condvarany} all operate on user-supplied
lockable objects. The \oldconcept{BasicLockable} requirements, the \oldconcept{Lockable} requirements,
the \oldconcept{TimedLockable} requirements,
the \oldconcept{SharedLockable} requirements, and
the \oldconcept{SharedTimedLock\-able} requirements
list the requirements imposed by these library types
in order to acquire or release ownership of a \tcode{lock} by a given execution agent.
\begin{note}
The nature of any lock ownership and any synchronization it entails are not part
of these requirements.
\end{note}

\pnum
A lock on an object \tcode{m} is said to be
\begin{itemize}
\item
a \defnadj{non-shared}{lock} if it is acquired by a call to
\tcode{lock},
\tcode{try_lock},
\tcode{try_lock_for}, or
\tcode{try_lock_until} on \tcode{m}, or
\item
a \defnadj{shared}{lock} if it is acquired by a call to
\tcode{lock_shared},
\tcode{try_lock_shared},
\tcode{try_lock_shared_for}, or
\tcode{try_lock_shared_until} on \tcode{m}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
Only the method of lock acquisition is considered;
the nature of any lock ownership is not part of these definitions.
\end{note}

\rSec1[thread.stoptoken]{Stop tokens}

\rSec2[thread.stoptoken.intro]{Introduction}

\pnum
Subclause \ref{thread.stoptoken} describes components that can be used
to asynchronously request that an operation stops execution in a timely manner,
typically because the result is no longer required.
Such a request is called a \defn{stop request}.

\pnum
\tcode{stop_source}, \tcode{stop_token}, and \tcode{stop_callback}
implement semantics of shared ownership of a \defn{stop state}.
Any \tcode{stop_source}, \tcode{stop_token}, or \tcode{stop_callback}
that shares ownership of the same stop state is an \defn{associated}
\tcode{stop_source}, \tcode{stop_token}, or \tcode{stop_callback}, respectively.
The last remaining owner of the stop state automatically
releases the resources associated with the stop state.

\pnum
A \tcode{stop_token} can be passed to an operation which can either
\begin{itemize}
 \item actively poll the token to check if there has been a stop request, or
 \item register a callback using the \tcode{stop_callback} class template which
        will be called in the event that a stop request is made.
\end{itemize}
A stop request made via a \tcode{stop_source} will be visible to all
associated \tcode{stop_token} and \tcode{stop_source} objects.
Once a stop request has been made it cannot be withdrawn
(a subsequent stop request has no effect).

\pnum
Callbacks registered via a \tcode{stop_callback} object are called when
a stop request is first made by any associated \tcode{stop_source} object.

\pnum
Calls to the functions \tcode{request_stop}, \tcode{stop_requested},
and \tcode{stop_possible}
do not introduce data races.
A call to \tcode{request_stop} that returns \tcode{true}
synchronizes with a call to \tcode{stop_requested}
on an associated \tcode{stop_token} or \tcode{stop_source} object
that returns \tcode{true}.
Registration of a callback synchronizes with the invocation of that callback.

\pnum
A mutex object facilitates protection against data races and allows safe synchronization of
data between execution agents\iref{thread.req.lockable}.
An execution agent \term{owns} a mutex from the time it successfully calls one of the
lock functions until it calls unlock. Mutexes can be either recursive or non-recursive, and can
grant simultaneous ownership to one or many execution agents. Both
recursive and non-recursive mutexes are supplied.

\rSec3[thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]{Mutex types}

\pnum
The \defn{mutex types} are the standard library types \tcode{mutex},

\tcode{shared_mutex}, and \tcode{shared_timed_mutex}.
They meet the requirements set out in \ref{thread.mutex.requirements.mutex}.
In this description, \tcode{m} denotes an object of a mutex type.
\begin{note}
The mutex types meet the \oldconcept{Lockable} requirements\iref{thread.req.lockable.req}.
\end{note}

\pnum
The mutex types meet \oldconcept{DefaultConstructible} and \oldconcept{Destructible}.
If initialization of an object of a mutex type fails,
an exception of type \tcode{system_error} is thrown.
The mutex types are neither copyable nor movable.

\pnum
The error conditions for error codes, if any, reported by member functions of the mutex types
are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{resource_unavailable_try_again} --- if any native handle type manipulated is not available.
\item \tcode{operation_not_permitted} --- if the thread does not have the
privilege to perform the operation.
\item \tcode{invalid_argument} --- if any native handle type manipulated as part of mutex
construction is incorrect.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The implementation provides lock and unlock operations, as described below.
For purposes of determining the existence of a data race, these behave as
atomic operations\iref{intro.multithread}. The lock and unlock operations on
a single mutex appears to occur in a single total order.
\begin{note}
This
can be viewed as the modification order\iref{intro.multithread} of the
mutex.
\end{note}

Construction and
destruction of an object of a mutex type need not be thread-safe; other
synchronization can be used to ensure that mutex objects are initialized

Attempts to obtain ownership of the mutex for the calling thread without
blocking. If ownership is not obtained, there is no effect and \tcode{try_lock()}
immediately returns. An implementation may fail to obtain the lock even if it is not

\begin{note}
This spurious failure is normally uncommon, but
allows interesting implementations based on a simple
compare and exchange\iref{atomics}.

An implementation should ensure that \tcode{try_lock()} does not consistently return \tcode{false}
in the absence of contending mutex acquisitions.

\rSec1[thread.condition]{Condition variables}

\rSec2[thread.condition.general]{General}

\pnum
Condition variables provide synchronization primitives used to block a thread until
notified by some other thread that some condition is met or until a system time is
reached. Class \tcode{condition_variable} provides a condition variable that can only
wait on an object of type \tcode{unique_lock<mutex>}, allowing the implementation
to be more efficient. Class \tcode{condition_variable_any} provides a general
condition variable that can wait on objects of user-supplied lock types.

\pnum
Condition variables permit concurrent invocation of the \tcode{wait}, \tcode{wait_for},
\tcode{wait_until}, \tcode{notify_one} and \tcode{notify_all} member functions.

\pnum
The executions of \tcode{notify_one} and \tcode{notify_all}
are atomic.
The executions of \tcode{wait}, \tcode{wait_for}, and \tcode{wait_until} are performed
in three atomic parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the release of the mutex and entry into the waiting state;
\item the unblocking of the wait; and
\item the reacquisition of the lock.
\end{enumerate}

\pnum
The implementation behaves as if all executions of \tcode{notify_one}, \tcode{notify_all}, and each
part of the \tcode{wait}, \tcode{wait_for}, and \tcode{wait_until} executions are
executed in a single unspecified total order consistent with the ``happens before'' order.

\pnum
Condition variable construction and destruction need not be synchronized.

supplied by all concurrently waiting (via \tcode{wait}, \tcode{wait_for},
or \tcode{wait_until}) threads.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\effects
Transfers ownership of the lock associated with \tcode{lk} into
internal storage and schedules \tcode{cond} to be notified when the current
thread exits, after all objects of thread storage duration associated with
the current thread have been destroyed. This notification is equivalent to:
\begin{codeblock}
lk.unlock();
cond.notify_all();
\end{codeblock}

\pnum
\sync
The implied \tcode{lk.unlock()} call is sequenced after the destruction of
all objects with thread storage duration associated with the current thread.

\pnum
\begin{note}
The supplied lock is held until the thread exits,
which might cause deadlock due to lock ordering issues.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
It is the user's responsibility to ensure that waiting threads
do not erroneously assume that the thread has finished if they experience
spurious wakeups. This typically requires that the condition being waited
for is satisfied while holding the lock on \tcode{lk}, and that this lock
is not released and reacquired prior to calling \tcode{notify_all_at_thread_exit}.

\rSec2[futures.state]{Shared state}

\pnum
Many of the classes introduced in subclause~\ref{futures} use some state to communicate results. This
\indextext{shared state|see{future, shared state}}
\defnx{shared state}{future!shared state} consists of some state information and some (possibly not
yet evaluated) \term{result}, which can be a (possibly void) value or an exception.
\begin{note}
Futures, promises, and tasks defined in this Clause reference such shared state.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
The result can be any kind of object including a function to compute that result,
as used by \tcode{async} when \tcode{policy} is \tcode{launch::deferred}.
\end{note}

\pnum
An \defn{asynchronous return object} is an object that reads results from a
shared state. A \defnadj{waiting}{function} of an asynchronous return object is one
that potentially blocks to wait for the shared state to be made
ready.
If a waiting function can return before the state is made ready because of a
timeout\iref{thread.req.lockable}, then it is a \term{timed waiting function}, otherwise
it is a \term{non-timed waiting function}.

\pnum
An \defn{asynchronous provider} is an object that provides a result to a shared
state.
The result of a shared state is set by
respective functions on the asynchronous provider.
\begin{note}
Such as promises or tasks.
\end{note}
The means of setting the result of a shared state is specified
in the description of those classes and functions that create such a state object.

\pnum
When an asynchronous return object or an asynchronous provider is said to release its
shared state, it means:
\begin{itemize}
\item
if the return object or provider holds the last reference to its shared state,
the shared state is destroyed; and

\item
the return object or provider gives up its reference to its shared state; and

\item these actions will not block for the shared state to become ready, except that it
may block if all of the following are true: the shared state was created by a call to
\tcode{std::async}, the shared state is not yet ready, and this was the last reference
to the shared state.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
When an asynchronous provider is said to make its shared state ready, it means:
\begin{itemize}
\item
first, the provider marks its shared state as ready; and
\item
second, the provider unblocks any execution agents waiting for its shared
state to become ready.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
When an asynchronous provider is said to abandon its shared state, it means:
\begin{itemize}
\item
first, if that state is not ready, the provider
\begin{itemize}
\item
stores an exception object of type \tcode{future_error} with an error condition of
\tcode{broken_promise} within its shared state; and then
\item
makes its shared state ready;
\end{itemize}
\item
second, the provider releases its shared state.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
A shared state is \defn{ready} only if it holds a value or an exception ready for
retrieval.
Waiting for a shared state to become ready may invoke code to compute the result on
the waiting thread if so specified in the description of the class or function that creates
the state object.

\pnum
Calls to functions that successfully set the stored result of a shared
state synchronize
with\iref{intro.multithread} calls to functions
successfully detecting the ready state resulting from that setting.
The storage of the result
(whether normal or exceptional) into the shared state
synchronizes with\iref{intro.multithread}
the successful return from a call to a waiting function on the shared state.

\pnum
Some functions (e.g., \tcode{promise::set_value_at_thread_exit}) delay making
the shared state ready until the calling thread exits. The destruction of
each of that thread's objects with thread storage duration\iref{basic.stc.thread}
is sequenced before making that shared state ready.

\pnum
Access to the result of the same shared state may conflict\iref{intro.multithread}.
\begin{note}
This explicitly specifies that the result of the shared state is
visible in the objects that reference this state in the sense of data race
avoidance\iref{res.on.data.races}. For example, concurrent accesses through
references returned by \tcode{shared_future::get()}\iref{futures.shared.future}
must either use read-only operations or provide additional synchronization.

\rSec2[futures.unique.future]{Class template \tcode{future}}

\pnum
The class template \tcode{future} defines a type for asynchronous return objects which
do not share their shared state with other asynchronous return objects.
A default-constructed \tcode{future} object has no
shared state. A \tcode{future} object with shared state can be created by
functions on asynchronous providers\iref{futures.state} or by the move constructor
and shares its shared state with
the original asynchronous provider. The result (value or exception) of
a \tcode{future} object
can be
set by
calling a respective function on an
object that shares the same
shared state.

\pnum
\begin{note}
Member functions of \tcode{future} do not synchronize with themselves or with
member functions of \tcode{shared_future}.

The effect of calling any member function other than the destructor, the
move-assignment operator, \tcode{share}, or \tcode{valid} on a \tcode{future} object for which

\begin{note}
It is valid to move from a future object for which \tcode{valid() == false}.

\rSec2[futures.shared.future]{Class template \tcode{shared_future}}

\pnum
The class template \tcode{shared_future} defines a type for asynchronous return objects
which may share their shared state with other asynchronous return
objects. A default-constructed \tcode{shared_future}
object has no shared state. A \tcode{shared_future} object with
shared state can
be created
by conversion from a \tcode{future} object and shares its shared state with the
original asynchronous provider\iref{futures.state} of the shared state.
The result (value or exception) of a \tcode{shared_future} object
can be set by
calling a respective function on an
object that shares the same shared state.

\pnum
\begin{note}
Member functions of \tcode{shared_future} do not synchronize with themselves,
but they synchronize with the shared state.

\pnum
The effect of calling any member function other than the destructor,
the move-assignment operator, the copy-assignment operator, or

It is valid to copy or move from a \tcode{shared_future}
object for which \tcode{valid()} is \tcode{false}.

\item \tcode{(is_constructible_v<decay_t<Args>, Args> \&\& ...)}, and
\item \tcode{is_invocable_v<decay_t<F>, decay_t<Args>...>}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\effects
The first function
behaves the same as a call to the second function with a \tcode{policy} argument of
\tcode{launch::async | launch::deferred}
and the same arguments for \tcode{F} and \tcode{Args}.
The second function creates a shared state that is associated with
the returned \tcode{future} object.
The further behavior
of the second function depends on the \tcode{policy} argument as follows (if
more than one of these conditions applies, the implementation may choose any of
the corresponding policies):

\begin{itemize}
\item
If \tcode{launch::async} is set in \tcode{policy}, calls
\tcode{invoke(\placeholdernc{decay-copy}(std::forward<F>(f)),}
\tcode{\placeholdernc{decay-\brk{}copy}(std::forward<Args>(args))...)}
(\ref{func.require}, \ref{thread.thread.constr})
as if in a new thread of execution represented by a \tcode{thread} object
with the calls to \tcode{\placeholder{decay-copy}} being evaluated in the thread that called \tcode{async}.
Any return value
is stored as the result in the
shared state. Any exception propagated from
the execution of
\tcode{invoke(\placeholdernc{decay-copy}(std::forward<F>(f)),
\placeholdernc{decay-copy}(std::forward\brk{}<Args>(args))...)}
is stored as the exceptional result in the shared state.
The \tcode{thread} object is
stored in the shared state
and affects the behavior of any asynchronous return objects that
reference that state.

\item
If \tcode{launch::deferred} is set in \tcode{policy},
stores \tcode{\placeholdernc{decay-copy}(std::forward<F>(f))} and
\tcode{\placeholdernc{decay-\brk{}copy}(std::forward<Args>(args))...}
in the shared state. These copies of \tcode{f} and \tcode{args} constitute
a \defnadj{deferred}{function}. Invocation of the deferred function evaluates
\tcode{invoke(std::move(g), std::move(xyz))} where \tcode{g} is the stored value of
\tcode{\placeholdernc{decay-copy}(std::forward<F>(f))} and \tcode{xyz} is the stored copy of
\tcode{\placeholdernc{decay-copy}(std::forward<Args>(args))...}.
Any return value is stored
as the result in the shared state.
Any exception propagated
from the execution
of the deferred function
is stored as the exceptional result
in the shared state.
The shared state is not
made ready until the function has completed. The first call to a
non-timed waiting function\iref{futures.state}
on an asynchronous return object referring to
this shared state invokes the
deferred function in the thread that called the waiting function.
Once evaluation of \tcode{invoke(std::move(g), std::move(xyz))} begins, the function is no longer
considered deferred.

\recommended
If this policy is specified together with other policies, such as when using a
\tcode{policy} value of \tcode{launch::async | launch::deferred}, implementations should defer
invocation or the selection of the policy when no more concurrency can be effectively
exploited.

\item
If no value is set in the launch policy, or a value is set that is neither specified
in this document nor by the implementation, the behavior is undefined.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\sync
The invocation of \tcode{async} synchronizes with the invocation of \tcode{f}.
The completion of the function \tcode{f} is sequenced before
the shared state is made ready.
\begin{note}
These apply regardless of the provided \tcode{policy} argument, and
even if the corresponding \tcode{future} object is moved to another thread.
However, it is possible for \tcode{f} not to be called at all,
in which case its completion never happens.
\end{note}

If the implementation chooses the \tcode{launch::async} policy,
\begin{itemize}
\item
a call to a waiting function on an asynchronous return
object that shares the shared state created by this \tcode{async} call shall
block until the associated thread has completed, as if joined, or else time
out\iref{thread.thread.member};
\item
the associated thread completion
synchronizes with\iref{intro.multithread}
the return from
the first function
that successfully detects the ready status of the shared state or
with the return from the last
function that releases the shared state, whichever
happens first.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\returns
An object of type
\tcode{future<invoke_result_t<decay_t<F>, decay_t<Args>...>>} that refers
to the shared state created by this call to \tcode{async}.
\begin{note}
If a future obtained from \tcode{async} is moved outside the local scope,
the future's destructor can block for the shared state to become ready.
\end{note}

\pnum
\throws

Line \#1 might not result in concurrency because
the \tcode{async} call uses the default policy, which might use
\tcode{launch::deferred}, in which case the lambda might not be invoked until the
\tcode{get()} call; in that case, \tcode{work1} and \tcode{work2} are called on the
