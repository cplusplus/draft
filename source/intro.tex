This International Standard specifies requirements for implementations
of the \Cpp programming language. The first such requirement is that
they implement the language, and so this International Standard also
defines \Cpp. Other requirements and relaxations of the first
requirement appear at various places within this International Standard.

\pnum
\Cpp is a general purpose programming language based on the C
programming language as described in ISO/IEC 9899:1999
\doccite{Programming languages --- C} (hereinafter referred to as the
\indexdefn{C!standard}\term{C standard}). In addition to
the facilities provided by C, \Cpp provides additional data types,
classes, templates, exceptions, namespaces, operator
overloading, function name overloading, references, free store
management operators, and additional library facilities.%

``undefined behavior.''

\pnum
\indextext{conformance requirements!method of description}%
Although this International Standard states only requirements on \Cpp
implementations, those requirements are often easier to understand if
they are phrased as requirements on programs, parts of programs, or
execution of programs. Such requirements have the following meaning:
\begin{itemize}

\item
If a program contains no violations of the rules in this
International Standard, a conforming implementation shall,
within its resource limits, accept and correctly execute\footnote{``Correct execution'' can include undefined behavior, depending on
the data being processed; see~\ref{intro.defs} and~\ref{intro.execution}.}
that program.

\item
\indextext{message!diagnostic}%
If a program contains a violation of any diagnosable rule or an occurrence
of a construct described in this Standard as ``conditionally-supported'' when
the implementation does not support that construct, a conforming implementation
shall issue at least one diagnostic message.

\item
\indextext{behavior!undefined}%
If a program contains a violation of a rule for which no diagnostic
is required, this International Standard places no requirement on
implementations with respect to that program.

For classes and class templates, the library Clauses specify partial
definitions. Private members~(Clause~\ref{class.access}) are not
specified, but each implementation shall supply them to complete the
definitions according to the description in the library Clauses.

\pnum
For functions, function templates, objects, and values, the library
Clauses specify declarations. Implementations shall supply definitions
consistent with the descriptions in the library Clauses.

\pnum
The names defined in the library have namespace
scope~(\ref{basic.namespace}). A \Cpp  translation
unit~(\ref{lex.phases}) obtains access to these names by including the
appropriate standard library header~(\ref{cpp.include}).

\pnum
The templates, classes, functions, and objects in the library have
external linkage~(\ref{basic.link}). The implementation provides
definitions for standard library entities, as necessary, while combining
translation units to form a complete \Cpp  program~(\ref{lex.phases}).%

\pnum
Two kinds of implementations are defined: a \defn{hosted implementation} and a

International Standard defines the set of available libraries. A freestanding

an operating system, and has an \impldef{required libraries for freestanding
implementation} set of libraries that includes certain language-support
libraries~(\ref{compliance}).

\pnum
A conforming implementation may have extensions (including
additional library functions), provided they do not alter the
behavior of any well-formed program.
Implementations are required to diagnose programs that use such
extensions that are ill-formed according to this International Standard.
Having done so, however, they can compile and execute such programs.

\pnum
Each implementation shall include documentation that identifies all
conditionally-supported constructs\indextext{behavior!conditionally-supported}

Annex~\ref{diff} summarizes the evolution of \Cpp  since its first

\rSec1[syntax]{Syntax notation}

\pnum
\indextext{notation!syntax|(}%
In the syntax notation used in this International Standard, syntactic
categories are indicated by \grammarterm{italic} type, and literal words
and characters in \tcode{constant} \tcode{width} type. Alternatives are
listed on separate lines except in a few cases where a long set of
alternatives is marked by the phrase ``one of.'' If the text of an alternative is too long to fit on a line, the text is continued on subsequent lines indented from the first one.
An optional terminal or non-terminal symbol is indicated by the subscript
``\opt'', so

\begin{ncbnf}
\terminal{\{} expression\opt{} \terminal{\}}
\end{ncbnf}

indicates an optional expression enclosed in braces.%

\pnum
Names for syntactic categories have generally been chosen according to
the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item \grammarterm{X-name} is a use of an identifier in a context that
determines its meaning (e.g., \grammarterm{class-name},
\grammarterm{typedef-name}).
\item \grammarterm{X-id} is an identifier with no context-dependent meaning
(e.g., \grammarterm{qualified-id}).
\item \grammarterm{X-seq} is one or more \grammarterm{X}'s without intervening
delimiters (e.g., \grammarterm{declaration-seq} is a sequence of
declarations).
\item \grammarterm{X-list} is one or more \grammarterm{X}'s separated by
intervening commas (e.g., \grammarterm{expression-list} is a sequence of
expressions separated by commas).
\end{itemize}%

\rSec1[intro.memory]{The \Cpp memory model}

\pnum
\indextext{memory model|(}%
The fundamental storage unit in the \Cpp memory model is the
\defn{byte}.
A byte is at least large enough to contain any member of the basic
\indextext{character set!basic execution}%
execution character set~(\ref{lex.charset})
and the eight-bit code units of the Unicode UTF-8 encoding form
and is composed of a contiguous sequence of
bits, the number of which is \impldef{bits in a byte}. The least
significant bit is called the \defn{low-order bit}; the most
significant bit is called the \defn{high-order bit}. The memory
available to a \Cpp program consists of one or more sequences of
contiguous bytes. Every byte has a unique address.

\pnum
\begin{note} The representation of types is described
in~\ref{basic.types}. \end{note}

\pnum
A \defn{memory location} is either an object of scalar type or a maximal
sequence of adjacent bit-fields all having non-zero width. \begin{note} Various
features of the language, such as references and virtual functions, might
involve additional memory locations that are not accessible to programs but are
managed by the implementation. \end{note} Two or more threads of
execution~(\ref{intro.multithread}) can access separate memory
locations without interfering with each other.

\pnum
\begin{note} Thus a bit-field and an adjacent non-bit-field are in separate memory
locations, and therefore can be concurrently updated by two threads of execution
without interference. The same applies to two bit-fields, if one is declared
inside a nested struct declaration and the other is not, or if the two are
separated by a zero-length bit-field declaration, or if they are separated by a
non-bit-field declaration. It is not safe to concurrently update two bit-fields
in the same struct if all fields between them are also bit-fields of non-zero
width. \end{note}

\pnum
\begin{example} A structure declared as

\begin{codeblock}
struct {
  char a;
  int b:5,
  c:11,
  :0,
  d:8;
  struct {int ee:8;} e;
}
\end{codeblock}

contains four separate memory locations: The field \tcode{a} and bit-fields
\tcode{d} and \tcode{e.ee} are each separate memory locations, and can be
modified concurrently without interfering with each other. The bit-fields
\tcode{b} and \tcode{c} together constitute the fourth memory location. The
bit-fields \tcode{b} and \tcode{c} cannot be concurrently modified, but
\tcode{b} and \tcode{a}, for example, can be. \end{example}%
\indextext{memory model|)}

\rSec1[intro.object]{The \Cpp object model}

\pnum
\indextext{object model|(}%
\indextext{object}%
The constructs in a \Cpp program create, destroy, refer to, access, and
manipulate objects. An \defn{object} is a region of storage.
\begin{note} A function is not an object, regardless of whether or not it
occupies storage in the way that objects do. \end{note} An object is
created by a \grammarterm{definition}~(\ref{basic.def}), by a
\grammarterm{new-expression}~(\ref{expr.new}) or by the
implementation~(\ref{class.temporary}) when needed. The properties of an
object are determined when the object is created. An object can have a
\grammarterm{name}~(Clause~\ref{basic}). An object has a \term{storage
duration}~(\ref{basic.stc}) which influences its
\term{lifetime}~(\ref{basic.life}). An object has a
\term{type}~(\ref{basic.types}). The term \defn{object type} refers to
the type with which the object is created.
Some objects are
\term{polymorphic}~(\ref{class.virtual}); the implementation
generates information associated with each such object that makes it
possible to determine that object's type during program execution. For
other objects, the interpretation of the values found therein is
determined by the type of the \grammarterm{expression}{s} (Clause~\ref{expr})
used to access them.

\pnum
\indextext{subobject}%
Objects can contain other objects, called \defnx{subobjects}{subobject}.
A subobject can be
a \defn{member subobject}~(\ref{class.mem}), a \defn{base class subobject}
(Clause~\ref{class.derived}), or an array element.
\indextext{object!complete}%
An object that is not a subobject of any other object is called a \defn{complete
object}.

\pnum
For every object \tcode{x}, there is some object called the
\defn{complete object of} \tcode{x}, determined as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item
If \tcode{x} is a complete object, then \tcode{x} is the complete
object of \tcode{x}.

\item
Otherwise, the complete object of \tcode{x} is the complete object
of the (unique) object that contains \tcode{x}.

\end{itemize}

\pnum
If a complete object, a data member~(\ref{class.mem}), or an array element is of
class type, its type is considered the \defn{most derived
class}, to distinguish it from the class type of any base class subobject;
an object of a most derived class type or of a non-class type is called a
\defn{most derived object}.

\pnum
\indextext{most derived object!bit-field}%
Unless it is a bit-field~(\ref{class.bit}), a most derived object shall have a
non-zero size and shall occupy one or more bytes of storage. Base class
subobjects may have zero size. An object of trivially copyable or
standard-layout type~(\ref{basic.types}) shall occupy contiguous bytes of
storage.

\pnum
\indextext{most derived object!bit-field}%
\indextext{most derived object!zero size subobject}%
Unless an object is a bit-field or a base class subobject of zero size, the
address of that object is the address of the first byte it occupies. Two
objects that are not bit-fields
may have the same address if one is a subobject of the other, or if at least
one is a base class subobject of zero size and they are of different types;
otherwise, they shall have distinct addresses.\footnote{Under the ``as-if'' rule an
implementation is allowed to store two objects at the same machine address or
not store an object at all if the program cannot observe the
difference~(\ref{intro.execution}).}

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
static const char test1 = 'x';
static const char test2 = 'x';
const bool b = &test1 != &test2;      // always true

Rather, conforming implementations are required to emulate (only) the observable
behavior of the abstract machine as explained below.\footnote{This provision is
sometimes called the ``as-if'' rule, because an implementation is free to
disregard any requirement of this International Standard as long as the result
is \emph{as if} the requirement had been obeyed, as far as can be determined
from the observable behavior of the program. For instance, an actual
implementation need not evaluate part of an expression if it can deduce that its
value is not used and that no

observable behavior of the program are produced.}

\indextext{behavior!implementation-defined}%

Certain aspects and operations of the abstract machine are described in this
International Standard as implementation-defined (for example,
\tcode{sizeof(int)}). These constitute the parameters of the abstract machine.
Each implementation shall include documentation describing its characteristics
and behavior in these respects.\footnote{This documentation also includes
conditionally-supported constructs and locale-specific behavior.
See~\ref{intro.compliance}.} Such documentation shall define the instance of the
abstract machine that corresponds to that implementation (referred to as the
``corresponding instance'' below).

\pnum
Certain other aspects and operations of the abstract machine are
described in this International Standard as unspecified (for example,
evaluation of expressions in a \grammarterm{new-initializer} if the allocation
function fails to allocate memory~(\ref{expr.new})). Where possible, this
International Standard defines a set of allowable behaviors. These
define the nondeterministic aspects of the abstract machine. An instance
of the abstract machine can thus have more than one possible execution
for a given program and a given input.

\indextext{behavior!undefined}%

Certain other operations are described in this International Standard as
undefined (for example, the effect of

A conforming implementation executing a well-formed program shall

requirement on the implementation executing that program with that input
(not even with regard to operations preceding the first undefined
operation).

\indextext{conformance requirements}
\pnum
The least requirements on a conforming implementation are:

\begin{itemize}

\item
Access to volatile objects are evaluated strictly according to the
rules of the abstract machine.

\item
At program termination, all data written into files shall be
identical to one of the possible results that execution of the program
according to the abstract semantics would have produced.

\item
The input and output dynamics of interactive devices shall take
place in such a fashion that prompting output is actually delivered before a program waits for input. What constitutes an interactive device is
\impldef{interactive device}.

\end{itemize}

These collectively are referred to as the
\defnx{observable behavior}{behavior!observable} of the program.

semantics may be defined by each implementation. \end{note}

\begin{note} Operators can be regrouped according to the usual
mathematical rules only where the operators really are associative or
commutative.\footnote{Overloaded operators are never assumed to be associative or
commutative. }
For example, in the following fragment
\begin{codeblock}
int a, b;
/*...*/
a = a + 32760 + b + 5;
\end{codeblock}
the expression statement behaves exactly the same as
\begin{codeblock}
a = (((a + 32760) + b) + 5);
\end{codeblock}
due to the associativity and precedence of these operators. Thus, the
result of the sum \tcode{(a + 32760)} is next added to \tcode{b}, and
that result is then added to 5 which results in the value assigned to
\tcode{a}. On a machine in which overflows produce an exception and in
which the range of values representable by an \tcode{int} is
\crange{-32768}{+32767}, the implementation cannot rewrite this
expression as
\begin{codeblock}
a = ((a + b) + 32765);
\end{codeblock}
since if the values for \tcode{a} and \tcode{b} were, respectively,
-32754 and -15, the sum \tcode{a + b} would produce an exception while
the original expression would not; nor can the expression be rewritten
either as
\begin{codeblock}
a = ((a + 32765) + b);
\end{codeblock}
or
\begin{codeblock}
a = (a + (b + 32765));
\end{codeblock}
since the values for \tcode{a} and \tcode{b} might have been,
respectively, 4 and -8 or -17 and 12. However on a machine in which
overflows do not produce an exception and in which the results of
overflows are reversible, the above expression statement can be
rewritten by the implementation in any of the above ways because the
same result will occur. \end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{full-expression}%
A \defn{full-expression} is an expression that is not a
subexpression of another expression.
\begin{note}
in some contexts, such as unevaluated operands, a syntactic
subexpression is considered a full-expression
(Clause~\ref{expr}).
\end{note}
If a language construct is defined
to produce an implicit call of a function, a use of the language
construct is considered to be an expression for the purposes of this
definition. A call to a destructor generated at the end of the lifetime
of an object other than a temporary object is an implicit
full-expression. Conversions applied to the result of an expression in
order to satisfy the requirements of the language construct in which the
expression appears are also considered to be part of the
full-expression.

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  S(int i): I(i) { }
  int& v() { return I; }
private:
  int I;
};

 S s1(1);           // full-expression is call of \tcode{S::S(int)}
 S s2 = 2;          // full-expression is call of \tcode{S::S(int)}

void f() {
  if (S(3).v())     // full-expression includes lvalue-to-rvalue and
                    // \tcode{int} to \tcode{bool} conversions, performed before
                    // temporary is deleted at end of full-expression

\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note} The evaluation of a full-expression can include the
evaluation of subexpressions that are not lexically part of the
full-expression. For example, subexpressions involved in evaluating
default arguments~(\ref{dcl.fct.default}) are considered to
be created in the expression that calls the function, not the expression
that defines the default argument. \end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{value computation|(}%
Reading an object designated by a \tcode{volatile}
glvalue~(\ref{basic.lval}), modifying an object, calling a library I/O
function, or calling a function that does any of those operations are
all
\defn{side effects}, which are changes in the state of the execution
environment. \defn{Evaluation} of an expression (or a
sub-expression) in general includes both value computations (including
determining the identity of an object for glvalue evaluation and fetching
a value previously assigned to an object for prvalue evaluation) and
initiation of side effects. When a call to a library I/O function
returns or an access to a \tcode{volatile} object is evaluated the side
effect is considered complete, even though some external actions implied
by the call (such as the I/O itself) or by the \tcode{volatile} access
may not have completed yet.

\pnum
\defn{Sequenced before} is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between
evaluations executed by a single thread~(\ref{intro.multithread}), which induces
a partial order among those evaluations. Given any two evaluations \term{A} and
\term{B}, if \term{A} is sequenced before \term{B}
(or, equivalently, \term{B} is \defn{sequenced after} \term{A}),
then the execution of
\term{A} shall precede the execution of \term{B}. If \term{A} is not sequenced
before \term{B} and \term{B} is not sequenced before \term{A}, then \term{A} and
\term{B} are \defn{unsequenced}. \begin{note} The execution of unsequenced
evaluations can overlap. \end{note} Evaluations \term{A} and \term{B} are
\defn{indeterminately sequenced} when either \term{A} is sequenced before
\term{B} or \term{B} is sequenced before \term{A}, but it is unspecified which.
\begin{note} Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but either
could be executed first. \end{note}

Every

sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the
next full-expression to be evaluated.\footnote{As specified
in~\ref{class.temporary}, after a full-expression is evaluated, a sequence of
zero or more invocations of destructor functions for temporary objects takes
place, usually in reverse order of the construction of each temporary object.}

\pnum
\indextext{evaluation!unspecified order~of}%
Except where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and
of subexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced. \begin{note}
In an expression that is evaluated more than once during the execution
of a program, unsequenced and indeterminately sequenced evaluations of
its subexpressions need not be performed consistently in different
evaluations. \end{note} The value computations of the operands of an
operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the
operator. If a
\indextext{side effects}%
side effect on a memory location~(\ref{intro.memory}) is unsequenced
relative to either another side effect on the same memory location or
a value computation using the value of any object in the same memory location,
and they are not potentially concurrent~(\ref{intro.multithread}),
the behavior is undefined.
\begin{note}
The next section imposes similar, but more complex restrictions on
potentially concurrent computations.
\end{note}

\begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
void f(int, int);
void g(int i, int* v) {
  i = v[i++];         // the behavior is undefined
  i = 7, i++, i++;    // \tcode{i} becomes \tcode{9}

  i = i++ + 1;        // the behavior is undefined
  i = i + 1;          // the value of \tcode{i} is incremented

  f(i = -1, i = -1);  // the behavior is undefined
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every
\indextext{value computation}%
value computation and
\indextext{side effects}%
side effect associated with any argument
expression, or with the postfix expression designating the called
function, is sequenced before execution of every expression or statement
in the body of the called function. \begin{note}
Value computations and
side effects associated with different argument expressions are
unsequenced. \end{note}
For each function invocation \term{F},
for every evaluation \term{A} that occurs within \term{F} and
every evaluation \term{B} that does not occur within \term{F} but
is evaluated on the same thread and as part of the same signal handler (if any),
either \term{A} is sequenced before \term{B} or
\term{B} is sequenced before \term{A}.
\footnote{In other words, function executions do not interleave with
each other.}
\begin{note}
If \term{A} and \term{B} would not otherwise be sequenced then they are
indeterminately sequenced.
\end{note}
Several contexts in \Cpp  cause evaluation of a function call, even
though no corresponding function call syntax appears in the translation
unit.
\begin{example}
Evaluation of a \grammarterm{new-expression} invokes one or more allocation
and constructor functions; see~\ref{expr.new}. For another example,
invocation of a conversion function~(\ref{class.conv.fct}) can arise in
contexts in which no function call syntax appears.
\end{example}
The sequencing constraints on the execution of the called function (as
described above) are features of the function calls as evaluated,
whatever the syntax of the expression that calls the function might be.%

A \defn{thread of execution} (also known as a \defn{thread}) is a single flow of
control within a program, including the initial invocation of a specific
top-level function, and recursively including every function invocation
subsequently executed by the thread. \begin{note} When one thread creates another,
the initial call to the top-level function of the new thread is executed by the
new thread, not by the creating thread. \end{note} Every thread in a program can
potentially access every object and function in a program.\footnote{An object
with automatic or thread storage duration~(\ref{basic.stc}) is associated with
one specific thread, and can be accessed by a different thread only indirectly
through a pointer or reference~(\ref{basic.compound}).} Under a hosted
implementation, a \Cpp program can have more than one thread running
concurrently. The execution of each thread proceeds as defined by the remainder
of this standard. The execution of the entire program consists of an execution
of all of its threads. \begin{note} Usually the execution can be viewed as an
interleaving of all its threads. However, some kinds of atomic operations, for
example, allow executions inconsistent with a simple interleaving, as described
below. \end{note} Under a freestanding implementation, it is \impldef{number of
threads in a program under a freestanding implementation} whether a program can
have more than one thread of execution.

\pnum
A signal handler that is executed as a result of a call to the \tcode{raise}
function belongs to the same thread of execution as the call to the
\tcode{raise} function. Otherwise it is unspecified which thread of execution
contains a signal handler invocation.

\pnum
Implementations should ensure that all unblocked threads eventually make
progress. \begin{note} Standard library functions may silently block on I/O or
locks. Factors in the execution environment, including externally-imposed thread
priorities, may prevent an implementation from making certain guarantees of
forward progress. \end{note}

\pnum
Executions of atomic functions
that are either defined to be lock-free~(\ref{atomics.flag})
or indicated as lock-free~(\ref{atomics.lockfree})
are \indexdefn{lock-free executions}\term{lock-free executions}.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  If there is only one unblocked thread,
  a lock-free execution in that thread shall complete.
  \begin{note}
    Concurrently executing threads
    may prevent progress of a lock-free execution.
    For example,
    this situation can occur
    with load-locked store-conditional implementations.
    This property is sometimes termed obstruction-free.
  \end{note}
\item
  When one or more lock-free executions run concurrently,
  at least one should complete.
  \begin{note}
    It is difficult for some implementations
    to provide absolute guarantees to this effect,
    since repeated and particularly inopportune interference
    from other threads
    may prevent forward progress,
    e.g.,
    by repeatedly stealing a cache line
    for unrelated purposes
    between load-locked and store-conditional instructions.
    Implementations should ensure
    that such effects cannot indefinitely delay progress
    under expected operating conditions,
    and that such anomalies
    can therefore safely be ignored by programmers.
    Outside this International Standard,
    this property is sometimes termed lock-free.

\pnum
The value of an object visible to a thread \term{T} at a particular point is the
initial value of the object, a value assigned to the object by \term{T}, or a
value assigned to the object by another thread, according to the rules below.
\begin{note} In some cases, there may instead be undefined behavior. Much of this
section is motivated by the desire to support atomic operations with explicit

simpler view for more restricted programs. \end{note}

\pnum
Two expression evaluations \defn{conflict} if one of them modifies a memory
location~(\ref{intro.memory}) and the other one reads or modifies the same
memory location.

\pnum
The library defines a number of atomic operations (Clause~\ref{atomics}) and
operations on mutexes (Clause~\ref{thread}) that are specially identified as
synchronization operations. These operations play a special role in making
assignments in one thread visible to another. A synchronization operation on one
or more memory locations is either a consume operation, an acquire operation, a
release operation, or both an acquire and release operation. A synchronization
operation without an associated memory location is a fence and can be either an
acquire fence, a release fence, or both an acquire and release fence. In
addition, there are relaxed atomic operations, which are not synchronization
operations, and atomic read-modify-write operations, which have special
characteristics. \begin{note} For example, a call that acquires a mutex will
perform an acquire operation on the locations comprising the mutex.
Correspondingly, a call that releases the same mutex will perform a release
operation on those same locations. Informally, performing a release operation on
\term{A} forces prior
\indextext{side effects}%
side effects on other memory locations to become visible
to other threads that later perform a consume or an acquire operation on
\term{A}. ``Relaxed'' atomic operations are not synchronization operations even
though, like synchronization operations, they cannot contribute to data races.
\end{note}

\pnum
All modifications to a particular atomic object \term{M} occur in some
particular total order, called the \defn{modification order} of \term{M}. If
\term{A} and \term{B} are modifications of an atomic object \term{M} and
\term{A} happens before (as defined below) \term{B}, then \term{A} shall precede
\term{B} in the modification order of \term{M}, which is defined below.
\begin{note} This states that the modification orders must respect the ``happens
before'' relationship. \end{note} \begin{note} There is a separate order for each
atomic object. There is no requirement that these can be combined into a single
total order for all objects. In general this will be impossible since different
threads may observe modifications to different objects in inconsistent orders.

\item is an atomic read-modify-write operation.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
Certain library calls \defn{synchronize with} other library calls performed by
another thread. For example, an atomic store-release synchronizes with a
load-acquire that takes its value from the store~(\ref{atomics.order}).
\begin{note} Except in the specified cases, reading a later value does not
necessarily ensure visibility as described below. Such a requirement would
sometimes interfere with efficient implementation. \end{note} \begin{note} The
specifications of the synchronization operations define when one reads the value
written by another. For atomic objects, the definition is clear. All operations
on a given mutex occur in a single total order. Each mutex acquisition ``reads
the value written'' by the last mutex release. \end{note}

\begin{note} The ``inter-thread happens before'' relation describes arbitrary
concatenations of ``sequenced before'', ``synchronizes with'' and
``dependency-ordered before'' relationships, with two exceptions. The first
exception is that a concatenation is not permitted to end with
``dependency-ordered before'' followed by ``sequenced before''. The reason for
this limitation is that a consume operation participating in a
``dependency-ordered before'' relationship provides ordering only with respect
to operations to which this consume operation actually carries a dependency. The
reason that this limitation applies only to the end of such a concatenation is
that any subsequent release operation will provide the required ordering for a
prior consume operation. The second exception is that a concatenation is not
permitted to consist entirely of ``sequenced before''. The reasons for this
limitation are (1) to permit ``inter-thread happens before'' to be transitively
closed and (2) the ``happens before'' relation, defined below, provides for
relationships consisting entirely of ``sequenced before''. \end{note}

ordinary objects are not visibly reordered. This is not actually detectable

\begin{note} The four preceding coherence requirements effectively disallow

Any such data race results in undefined
behavior. \begin{note} It can be shown that programs that correctly use mutexes

other synchronization operations behave as if the operations executed by their
constituent threads were simply interleaved, with each

value computation of an

side effect on that object in that
interleaving. This is normally referred to as ``sequential consistency''.
However, this applies only to data-race-free programs, and data-race-free
programs cannot observe most program transformations that do not change
single-threaded program semantics. In fact, most single-threaded program
transformations continue to be allowed, since any program that behaves
differently as a result must perform an undefined operation. \end{note}

all evaluations in \placeholder{A} happened before the execution of the signal

\pnum
\begin{note} Compiler transformations that introduce assignments to a potentially
shared memory location that would not be modified by the abstract machine are
generally precluded by this standard, since such an assignment might overwrite
another assignment by a different thread in cases in which an abstract machine

of data member assignment that overwrite adjacent members in separate memory
locations. Reordering of atomic loads in cases in which the atomics in question
may alias is also generally precluded, since this may violate the coherence
rules. \end{note}

\begin{note} Transformations that introduce a speculative read of a potentially
shared memory location may not preserve the semantics of the \Cpp program as

specific machine with well-defined semantics for data races. They would be
invalid for a hypothetical machine that is not tolerant of races or provides
hardware race detection. \end{note}

\begin{note} This is intended to allow compiler transformations such as removal of
empty loops, even when termination cannot be proven. \end{note}

\pnum
An implementation should ensure that the last value (in modification order)
assigned by an atomic or synchronization operation will become visible to all
other threads in a finite period of time.%

The \Cpp  programming language as described in this International
Standard is based on the language as described in Chapter R (Reference
Manual) of Stroustrup: \doccite{The \Cpp  Programming Language} (second
edition, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, ISBN 0-201-53992-6,
copyright \copyright 1991 AT\&T). That, in turn, is based on the C
programming language as described in Appendix A of Kernighan and
Ritchie: \doccite{The C Programming Language} (Prentice-Hall, 1978, ISBN
