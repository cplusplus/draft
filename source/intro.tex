This document specifies requirements for implementations
of the \Cpp{} programming language. The first such requirement is that
they implement the language, so this document also
defines \Cpp{}. Other requirements and relaxations of the first
requirement appear at various places within this document.

\pnum
\Cpp{} is a general purpose programming language based on the C
programming language as described in ISO/IEC 9899:2011
\doccite{Programming languages --- C} (hereinafter referred to as the
\defnx{C standard}{C!standard}). \Cpp{} provides many facilities
beyond those provided by C, including additional data types,
classes, templates, exceptions, namespaces, operator
overloading, function name overloading, references, free store
management operators, and additional library facilities.%

behaving during translation or program execution in a documented manner
characteristic of the environment (with or without the issuance of a
diagnostic message), to terminating a translation or execution (with the
issuance of a diagnostic message). Many erroneous program constructs do
not engender undefined behavior; they are required to be diagnosed.

except for those rules containing an explicit notation that
``no diagnostic is required'' or which are described as resulting in
``undefined behavior''.

\pnum
\indextext{conformance requirements!method of description}%
Although this document states only requirements on \Cpp{}
implementations, those requirements are often easier to understand if
they are phrased as requirements on programs, parts of programs, or
execution of programs. Such requirements have the following meaning:
\begin{itemize}
\item
If a program contains no violations of the rules in this
document, a conforming implementation shall,
within its resource limits, accept and correctly execute\footnote{``Correct execution'' can include undefined behavior, depending on
the data being processed; see \ref{intro.defs} and~\ref{intro.execution}.}
that program.
\item
\indextext{message!diagnostic}%
If a program contains a violation of any diagnosable rule or an occurrence
of a construct described in this document as ``conditionally-supported'' when
the implementation does not support that construct, a conforming implementation
shall issue at least one diagnostic message.
\item
\indextext{behavior!undefined}%
If a program contains a violation of a rule for which no diagnostic
is required, this document places no requirement on
implementations with respect to that program.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
During template argument deduction and substitution,
certain constructs that in other contexts require a diagnostic
are treated differently;
see~\ref{temp.deduct}.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{conformance requirements!library|(}%
\indextext{conformance requirements!classes}%
\indextext{conformance requirements!class templates}%
For classes and class templates, the library Clauses specify partial
definitions. Private members\iref{class.access} are not
specified, but each implementation shall supply them to complete the
definitions according to the description in the library Clauses.

\pnum
For functions, function templates, objects, and values, the library
Clauses specify declarations. Implementations shall supply definitions
consistent with the descriptions in the library Clauses.

\pnum
The names defined in the library have namespace
scope\iref{basic.namespace}. A \Cpp{}  translation
unit\iref{lex.phases} obtains access to these names by including the
appropriate standard library header\iref{cpp.include}.

\pnum
The templates, classes, functions, and objects in the library have
external linkage\iref{basic.link}. The implementation provides
definitions for standard library entities, as necessary, while combining
translation units to form a complete \Cpp{}  program\iref{lex.phases}.%

\pnum
Two kinds of implementations are defined: a \defn{hosted implementation} and a
\defn{freestanding implementation}. For a hosted implementation, this
document defines the set of available libraries. A freestanding
implementation is one in which execution may take place without the benefit of
an operating system, and has an \impldef{required libraries for freestanding
implementation} set of libraries that includes certain language-support
libraries\iref{compliance}.

\pnum
A conforming implementation may have extensions (including
additional library functions), provided they do not alter the
behavior of any well-formed program.
Implementations are required to diagnose programs that use such
extensions that are ill-formed according to this document.
Having done so, however, they can compile and execute such programs.

\pnum
Each implementation shall include documentation that identifies all
conditionally-supported constructs\indextext{behavior!conditionally-supported}
that it does not support and defines all locale-specific characteristics.\footnote{This documentation also defines implementation-defined behavior;

\rSec2[intro.abstract]{Abstract machine}

\pnum
\indextext{program execution|(}%
\indextext{program execution!abstract machine}%
The semantic descriptions in this document define a
parameterized nondeterministic abstract machine. This document
places no requirement on the structure of conforming
implementations. In particular, they need not copy or emulate the
structure of the abstract machine.
\indextext{as-if rule}%
\indextext{behavior!observable}%
Rather, conforming implementations are required to emulate (only) the observable
behavior of the abstract machine as explained below.\footnote{This provision is
sometimes called the ``as-if'' rule, because an implementation is free to
disregard any requirement of this document as long as the result
is \emph{as if} the requirement had been obeyed, as far as can be determined
from the observable behavior of the program. For instance, an actual
implementation need not evaluate part of an expression if it can deduce that its
value is not used and that no
\indextext{side effects}%
side effects affecting the
observable behavior of the program are produced.}

\pnum
\indextext{behavior!implementation-defined}%
Certain aspects and operations of the abstract machine are described in this
document as implementation-defined (for example,
\tcode{sizeof(int)}). These constitute the parameters of the abstract machine.
Each implementation shall include documentation describing its characteristics
and behavior in these respects.\footnote{This documentation also includes
conditionally-supported constructs and locale-specific behavior.
See~\ref{intro.compliance}.} Such documentation shall define the instance of the
abstract machine that corresponds to that implementation (referred to as the
``corresponding instance'' below).

\pnum
\indextext{behavior!unspecified}%
Certain other aspects and operations of the abstract machine are
described in this document as unspecified (for example,
order of evaluation of arguments in a function call\iref{expr.call}).
Where possible, this
document defines a set of allowable behaviors. These
define the nondeterministic aspects of the abstract machine. An instance
of the abstract machine can thus have more than one possible execution
for a given program and a given input.

\pnum
\indextext{behavior!undefined}%
Certain other operations are described in this document as
undefined (for example, the effect of
attempting to modify a const object).
\begin{note} This document imposes no requirements on the
behavior of programs that contain undefined behavior. \end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{program!well-formed}%
\indextext{behavior!observable}%
A conforming implementation executing a well-formed program shall
produce the same observable behavior as one of the possible executions
of the corresponding instance of the abstract machine with the
same program and the same input.
\indextext{behavior!undefined}%
However, if any such execution contains an undefined operation, this document places no
requirement on the implementation executing that program with that input
(not even with regard to operations preceding the first undefined
operation).

\pnum
\indextext{conformance requirements}%
The least requirements on a conforming implementation are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Accesses through volatile glvalues are evaluated strictly according to the
rules of the abstract machine.
\item
At program termination, all data written into files shall be
identical to one of the possible results that execution of the program
according to the abstract semantics would have produced.
\item
The input and output dynamics of interactive devices shall take
place in such a fashion that prompting output is actually delivered before a program waits for input. What constitutes an interactive device is
\impldef{interactive device}.
\end{itemize}

These collectively are referred to as the
\defnx{observable behavior}{behavior!observable} of the program.
\begin{note} More stringent correspondences between abstract and actual
semantics may be defined by each implementation. \end{note}

\rSec1[syntax]{Syntax notation}

\pnum
\indextext{notation!syntax|(}%
In the syntax notation used in this document, syntactic
categories are indicated by \fakegrammarterm{italic} type, and literal words
and characters in \tcode{constant} \tcode{width} type. Alternatives are
listed on separate lines except in a few cases where a long set of
alternatives is marked by the phrase ``one of''. If the text of an alternative is too long to fit on a line, the text is continued on subsequent lines indented from the first one.
An optional terminal or non-terminal symbol is indicated by the subscript
``\opt{\relax}'', so

\begin{ncbnf}
\terminal{\{} \opt{expression} \terminal{\}}
\end{ncbnf}

indicates an optional expression enclosed in braces.%

\pnum
Names for syntactic categories have generally been chosen according to
the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item \fakegrammarterm{X-name} is a use of an identifier in a context that
determines its meaning (e.g., \grammarterm{class-name},
\grammarterm{typedef-name}).
\item \fakegrammarterm{X-id} is an identifier with no context-dependent meaning
(e.g., \grammarterm{qualified-id}).
\item \fakegrammarterm{X-seq} is one or more \fakegrammarterm{X}'s without intervening
delimiters (e.g., \grammarterm{declaration-seq} is a sequence of
declarations).
\item \fakegrammarterm{X-list} is one or more \fakegrammarterm{X}'s separated by
intervening commas (e.g., \grammarterm{identifier-list} is a sequence of
identifiers separated by commas).
