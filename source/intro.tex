This International Standard specifies requirements for implementations
of the \Cpp programming language. The first such requirement is that
they implement the language, and so this International Standard also
defines \Cpp. Other requirements and relaxations of the first
requirement appear at various places within this International Standard.

\pnum
\Cpp is a general purpose programming language based on the C
programming language as described in ISO/IEC 9899:1999
\doccite{Programming languages --- C} (hereinafter referred to as the
\indexdefn{C!standard}\term{C standard}). In addition to
the facilities provided by C, \Cpp provides additional data types,
classes, templates, exceptions, namespaces, operator
overloading, function name overloading, references, free store
management operators, and additional library facilities.%

\pnum
\indextext{conformance requirements!method of description}%
Although this International Standard states only requirements on \Cpp
implementations, those requirements are often easier to understand if
they are phrased as requirements on programs, parts of programs, or
execution of programs. Such requirements have the following meaning:
\begin{itemize}

\item
If a program contains no violations of the rules in this
International Standard, a conforming implementation shall,
within its resource limits, accept and correctly execute\footnote{``Correct execution'' can include undefined behavior, depending on
the data being processed; see~\ref{intro.defs} and~\ref{intro.execution}.}
that program.

\item
\indextext{message!diagnostic}%
If a program contains a violation of any diagnosable rule or an occurrence
of a construct described in this Standard as ``conditionally-supported'' when
the implementation does not support that construct, a conforming implementation
shall issue at least one diagnostic message.

\item

For functions, function templates, objects, and values, the library
Clauses specify declarations. Implementations shall supply definitions

Two kinds of implementations are defined: a \defn{hosted implementation} and a

A conforming implementation may have extensions (including
additional library functions), provided they do not alter the

In the syntax notation used in this International Standard, syntactic
categories are indicated by \grammarterm{italic} type, and literal words

listed on separate lines except in a few cases where a long set of
alternatives is marked by the phrase ``one of.'' If the text of an alternative is too long to fit on a line, the text is continued on subsequent lines indented from the first one.
An optional terminal or non-terminal symbol is indicated by the subscript
``\opt'', so

\begin{ncbnf}
\terminal{\{} expression\opt \terminal{\}}

indicates an optional expression enclosed in braces.%

\pnum
Names for syntactic categories have generally been chosen according to
the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item \grammarterm{X-name} is a use of an identifier in a context that
determines its meaning (e.g., \grammarterm{class-name},
\grammarterm{typedef-name}).
\item \grammarterm{X-id} is an identifier with no context-dependent meaning
(e.g., \grammarterm{qualified-id}).
\item \grammarterm{X-seq} is one or more \grammarterm{X}'s without intervening
delimiters (e.g., \grammarterm{declaration-seq} is a sequence of
declarations).
\item \grammarterm{X-list} is one or more \grammarterm{X}'s separated by
intervening commas (e.g., \grammarterm{expression-list} is a sequence of
expressions separated by commas).

execution character set~(\ref{lex.charset})
and the eight-bit code units of the Unicode UTF-8 encoding form
and is composed of a contiguous sequence of
bits, the number of which is \impldef{bits in a byte}. The least
significant bit is called the \defn{low-order bit}; the most
significant bit is called the \defn{high-order bit}. The memory
available to a \Cpp program consists of one or more sequences of
contiguous bytes. Every byte has a unique address.

\pnum
\enternote The representation of types is described
in~\ref{basic.types}. \exitnote

\pnum
A \defn{memory location} is either an object of scalar type or a maximal
sequence of adjacent bit-fields all having non-zero width. \enternote Various
features of the language, such as references and virtual functions, might
involve additional memory locations that are not accessible to programs but are
managed by the implementation. \exitnote Two or more threads of
execution~(\ref{intro.multithread}) can update and access separate memory
locations without interfering with each other.

\pnum
\enternote Thus a bit-field and an adjacent non-bit-field are in separate memory
locations, and therefore can be concurrently updated by two threads of execution
without interference. The same applies to two bit-fields, if one is declared
inside a nested struct declaration and the other is not, or if the two are
separated by a zero-length bit-field declaration, or if they are separated by a
non-bit-field declaration. It is not safe to concurrently update two bit-fields
in the same struct if all fields between them are also bit-fields of non-zero
width. \exitnote

modified concurrently without interfering with each other. The bit-fields

The constructs in a \Cpp program create, destroy, refer to, access, and
manipulate objects. An \defn{object} is a region of storage.
\enternote A function is not an object, regardless of whether or not it
occupies storage in the way that objects do. \exitnote An object is
created by a \grammarterm{definition}~(\ref{basic.def}), by a
\grammarterm{new-expression}~(\ref{expr.new}) or by the
implementation~(\ref{class.temporary}) when needed. The properties of an
object are determined when the object is created. An object can have a
\grammarterm{name}~(Clause~\ref{basic}). An object has a \term{storage
duration}~(\ref{basic.stc}) which influences its
\term{lifetime}~(\ref{basic.life}). An object has a
\term{type}~(\ref{basic.types}). The term \defn{object type} refers to
the type with which the object is created.
Some objects are
\term{polymorphic}~(\ref{class.virtual}); the implementation
generates information associated with each such object that makes it
possible to determine that object's type during program execution. For
other objects, the interpretation of the values found therein is
determined by the type of the \grammarterm{expression}{s} (Clause~\ref{expr})
used to access them.

\pnum
\indextext{subobject}%
Objects can contain other objects, called \defnx{subobjects}{subobject}.
A subobject can be

For every object \tcode{x}, there is some object called the
\defn{complete object of} \tcode{x}, determined as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item
If \tcode{x} is a complete object, then \tcode{x} is the complete
object of \tcode{x}.

\item
Otherwise, the complete object of \tcode{x} is the complete object
of the (unique) object that contains \tcode{x}.

\end{itemize}

\pnum
If a complete object, a data member~(\ref{class.mem}), or an array element is of
class type, its type is considered the \defn{most derived

an object of a most derived class type or of a non-class type is called a
\defn{most derived object}.

\pnum
\indextext{most derived object!bit-field}%
Unless it is a bit-field~(\ref{class.bit}), a most derived object shall have a
non-zero size and shall occupy one or more bytes of storage. Base class

storage.

one is a base class subobject of zero size and they are of different types;
otherwise, they shall have distinct addresses.\footnote{Under the ``as-if'' rule an

\enternote Operators can be regrouped according to the usual
mathematical rules only where the operators really are associative or
commutative.\footnote{Overloaded operators are never assumed to be associative or
commutative. }
For example, in the following fragment
\begin{codeblock}
int a, b;
/*...*/
a = a + 32760 + b + 5;
\end{codeblock}
the expression statement behaves exactly the same as
\begin{codeblock}
a = (((a + 32760) + b) + 5);
\end{codeblock}
due to the associativity and precedence of these operators. Thus, the
result of the sum \tcode{(a + 32760)} is next added to \tcode{b}, and
that result is then added to 5 which results in the value assigned to
\tcode{a}. On a machine in which overflows produce an exception and in
which the range of values representable by an \tcode{int} is
\crange{-32768}{+32767}, the implementation cannot rewrite this
expression as
\begin{codeblock}
a = ((a + b) + 32765);
\end{codeblock}
since if the values for \tcode{a} and \tcode{b} were, respectively,
-32754 and -15, the sum \tcode{a + b} would produce an exception while
the original expression would not; nor can the expression be rewritten
either as
\begin{codeblock}
a = ((a + 32765) + b);
\end{codeblock}
or
\begin{codeblock}
a = (a + (b + 32765));
\end{codeblock}
since the values for \tcode{a} and \tcode{b} might have been,
respectively, 4 and -8 or -17 and 12. However on a machine in which
overflows do not produce an exception and in which the results of
overflows are reversible, the above expression statement can be
rewritten by the implementation in any of the above ways because the
same result will occur. \exitnote

A \defn{full-expression} is an expression that is not a

\enternote
in some contexts, such as unevaluated operands, a syntactic

(Clause~\ref{expr}).
\exitnote
If a language construct is defined
to produce an implicit call of a function, a use of the language
construct is considered to be an expression for the purposes of this
definition. A call to a destructor generated at the end of the lifetime
of an object other than a temporary object is an implicit
full-expression. Conversions applied to the result of an expression in
order to satisfy the requirements of the language construct in which the
expression appears are also considered to be part of the
full-expression.

determining the identity of an object for glvalue evaluation and fetching
a value previously assigned to an object for prvalue evaluation) and

the called function.\footnote{In other words, function executions do not interleave with
each other.}
Several contexts in \Cpp  cause evaluation of a function call, even
though no corresponding function call syntax appears in the translation
unit.

Evaluation of a \tcode{new} expression invokes one or more allocation

invocation of a conversion function~(\ref{class.conv.fct}) can arise in

A \defn{thread of execution} (also known as a \defn{thread}) is a single flow of
control within a program, including the initial invocation of a specific
top-level function, and recursively including every function invocation
subsequently executed by the thread. \enternote When one thread creates another,
the initial call to the top-level function of the new thread is executed by the
new thread, not by the creating thread. \exitnote Every thread in a program can
potentially access every object and function in a program.\footnote{An object
with automatic or thread storage duration~(\ref{basic.stc}) is associated with
one specific thread, and can be accessed by a different thread only indirectly
through a pointer or reference~(\ref{basic.compound}).} Under a hosted
implementation, a \Cpp program can have more than one thread running
concurrently. The execution of each thread proceeds as defined by the remainder
of this standard. The execution of the entire program consists of an execution
of all of its threads. \enternote Usually the execution can be viewed as an
interleaving of all its threads. However, some kinds of atomic operations, for
example, allow executions inconsistent with a simple interleaving, as described
below. \exitnote Under a freestanding implementation, it is \impldef{number of
threads in a program under a freestanding implementation} whether a program can
have more than one thread of execution.

\pnum
Implementations should ensure that all unblocked threads eventually make

Two expression evaluations \defn{conflict} if one of them modifies a memory

\pnum
The library defines a number of atomic operations (Clause~\ref{atomics}) and
operations on mutexes (Clause~\ref{thread}) that are specially identified as
synchronization operations. These operations play a special role in making
assignments in one thread visible to another. A synchronization operation on one
or more memory locations is either a consume operation, an acquire operation, a
release operation, or both an acquire and release operation. A synchronization
operation without an associated memory location is a fence and can be either an
acquire fence, a release fence, or both an acquire and release fence. In
addition, there are relaxed atomic operations, which are not synchronization
operations, and atomic read-modify-write operations, which have special
characteristics. \enternote For example, a call that acquires a mutex will
perform an acquire operation on the locations comprising the mutex.
Correspondingly, a call that releases the same mutex will perform a release
operation on those same locations. Informally, performing a release operation on
\term{A} forces prior
\indextext{side effects}%
side effects on other memory locations to become visible
to other threads that later perform a consume or an acquire operation on
\term{A}. ``Relaxed'' atomic operations are not synchronization operations even
though, like synchronization operations, they cannot contribute to data races.
\exitnote

\pnum
All modifications to a particular atomic object \term{M} occur in some
particular total order, called the \defn{modification order} of \term{M}. If
\term{A} and \term{B} are modifications of an atomic object \term{M} and
\term{A} happens before (as defined below) \term{B}, then \term{A} shall precede
\term{B} in the modification order of \term{M}, which is defined below.
\enternote This states that the modification orders must respect the ``happens
before'' relationship. \exitnote \enternote There is a separate order for each
atomic object. There is no requirement that these can be combined into a single
total order for all objects. In general this will be impossible since different
threads may observe modifications to different objects in inconsistent orders.

Certain library calls \defn{synchronize with} other library calls performed by

necessarily ensure visibility as described below. Such a requirement would
sometimes interfere with efficient implementation. \exitnote \enternote The
specifications of the synchronization operations define when one reads the value

\enternote The ``inter-thread happens before'' relation describes arbitrary
concatenations of ``sequenced before'', ``synchronizes with'' and
``dependency-ordered before'' relationships, with two exceptions. The first
exception is that a concatenation is not permitted to end with
``dependency-ordered before'' followed by ``sequenced before''. The reason for
this limitation is that a consume operation participating in a
``dependency-ordered before'' relationship provides ordering only with respect
to operations to which this consume operation actually carries a dependency. The
reason that this limitation applies only to the end of such a concatenation is
that any subsequent release operation will provide the required ordering for a
prior consume operation. The second exception is that a concatenation is not
permitted to consist entirely of ``sequenced before''. The reasons for this
limitation are (1) to permit ``inter-thread happens before'' to be transitively
closed and (2) the ``happens before'' relation, defined below, provides for
relationships consisting entirely of ``sequenced before''. \exitnote

However, this applies only to data-race-free programs, and data-race-free

of data member assignment that overwrite adjacent members in separate memory
locations. Reordering of atomic loads in cases in which the atomics in question
may alias is also generally precluded, since this may violate the ``visible
