A class is a type.

Its name becomes a \grammarterm{class-name}\iref{class.name} within its
scope.

\end{bnf}

A \grammarterm{class-specifier} or
an \grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier}\iref{dcl.type.elab} is used to
make a \grammarterm{class-name}. An object of a class consists of a
(possibly empty) sequence of members and base class objects.

\end{bnf}

A class declaration where the \grammarterm{class-name}
in the \grammarterm{class-head-name} is a \grammarterm{simple-template-id}
shall be an explicit specialization\iref{temp.expl.spec} or
a partial specialization\iref{temp.spec.partial}.
A \grammarterm{class-specifier} whose
\grammarterm{class-head} omits the
\grammarterm{class-head-name} defines an unnamed class.
\begin{note}
An unnamed class thus can't
be \tcode{final}.
\end{note}
Otherwise, the \grammarterm{class-name} is an \grammarterm{identifier};
it is not looked up, and the \grammarterm{class-specifier} introduces it.

\pnum
The
\grammarterm{class-name} is also bound in the scope of the class (template)
itself; this is known as the \defn{injected-class-name}.
For purposes of access checking, the injected-class-name is treated as
if it were a public member name.
A \grammarterm{class-specifier} is commonly referred to as a \defnx{class
definition}{definition!class}.
A class is considered defined after the closing brace of its
\grammarterm{class-specifier} has been seen even though its member
functions are in general not yet defined.
The optional \grammarterm{attribute-specifier-seq} appertains to the class; the attributes in
the \grammarterm{attribute-specifier-seq} are thereafter considered attributes of the class
whenever it is named.

\pnum
If a \grammarterm{class-head-name} contains a \grammarterm{nested-name-specifier},
the \grammarterm{class-specifier} shall not inhabit a class scope.
If its \grammarterm{class-name} is an \grammarterm{identifier},
the \grammarterm{class-specifier} shall correspond to
one or more declarations nominable in
the class, class template, or namespace to which the
\grammarterm{nested-name-specifier} refers;
they shall all have the same target scope, and the target scope of the
\grammarterm{class-specifier} is that scope.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
namespace N {
  template<class>
  struct A {
    struct B;
  };
}
using N::A;
template<class T> struct A<T>::B {};    // OK
template<> struct A<void> {};           // OK
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
The \grammarterm{class-key} determines
whether the class is a union\iref{class.union} and
whether access is public or private by default\iref{class.access}.
A union holds the value of at most one data member at a time.
\end{note}

\pnum
If a class is marked with the \grammarterm{class-virt-specifier} \tcode{final} and it appears
as a \grammarterm{class-or-decltype} in a \grammarterm{base-clause}\iref{class.derived},
the program is ill-formed. Whenever a
\grammarterm{class-key} is followed by a \grammarterm{class-head-name}, the
\grammarterm{identifier} \tcode{final}, and a colon or left brace, \tcode{final} is
interpreted as a \grammarterm{class-virt-specifier}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A;
struct A final {};      // OK: definition of \tcode{struct A},
                        // not value-initialization of variable \tcode{final}

struct X {
 struct C { constexpr operator int() { return 5; } };
 struct B final : C{};  // OK: definition of nested class \tcode{B},
                        // not declaration of a bit-field member \tcode{final}
};
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
Complete objects of class type have nonzero size.
Base class subobjects and
members declared with the \tcode{no_unique_address} attribute\iref{dcl.attr.nouniqueaddr}
are not so constrained.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
Class objects can be assigned~(\ref{over.ass}, \ref{class.copy.assign}),
passed as arguments to functions~(\ref{dcl.init}, \ref{class.copy.ctor}), and
returned by functions (except objects of classes for which copying or moving has
been restricted; see~\ref{dcl.fct.def.delete} and \ref{class.access}).
Other plausible operators, such as equality comparison,
can be defined by the user; see~\ref{over.oper}.

\pnum
A \defnadj{trivially copyable}{class} is a class:
\begin{itemize}
\item that has at least one eligible
copy constructor, move constructor,
copy assignment operator, or
move assignment operator~(\ref{special}, \ref{class.copy.ctor}, \ref{class.copy.assign}),
\item where each eligible copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator,
and move assignment operator is trivial, and
\item that has a trivial, non-deleted destructor\iref{class.dtor}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
A \defnadj{trivial}{class} is a class that is trivially copyable and
has one or more eligible default constructors\iref{class.default.ctor},
all of which are trivial.
\begin{note}
In particular, a trivially copyable or trivial class does not have
virtual functions or virtual base classes.
\end{note}

\pnum
A class \tcode{S} is a \defnadj{standard-layout}{class} if it:
\begin{itemize}
\item has no non-static data members of type non-standard-layout class
(or array of such types) or reference,

\item has no virtual functions\iref{class.virtual} and no
virtual base classes\iref{class.mi},

\item has the same access control\iref{class.access}
for all non-static data members,

\item has no non-standard-layout base classes,

\item has at most one base class subobject of any given type,

\item has all non-static data members and bit-fields in the class and
its base classes first declared in the same class, and

\item has no element of the set $M(\mathtt{S})$ of types
as a base class,
where for any type \tcode{X}, $M(\mathtt{X})$ is defined as follows.
\begin{footnote}

This ensures that two subobjects that have the same class type and that
belong to the same most derived object are not allocated at the same
address\iref{expr.eq}.
\end{footnote}
\begin{note}
$M(\mathtt{X})$ is the set of the types of all non-base-class subobjects
that can be at a zero offset in \tcode{X}.
\end{note}

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{X} is a non-union class type with no non-static data members,
the set $M(\mathtt{X})$ is empty.

\item If \tcode{X} is a non-union class type with a non-static data
member of type $\mathtt{X}_0$
that is either of zero size or
is the first non-static data member of \tcode{X}
(where said member may be an anonymous union),
the set $M(\mathtt{X})$ consists of $\mathtt{X}_0$ and the elements of
$M(\mathtt{X}_0)$.

\item If \tcode{X} is a union type, the set $M(\mathtt{X})$ is
the union of all $M(\mathtt{U}_i)$ and the set containing all $\mathtt{U}_i$,
where each $\mathtt{U}_i$ is the type of the $i^\text{th}$ non-static data member
of \tcode{X}.

\item If \tcode{X} is an array type with element type $\mathtt{X}_e$,
the set $M(\mathtt{X})$ consists of $\mathtt{X}_e$
and the elements of $M(\mathtt{X}_e)$.

\item If \tcode{X} is a non-class, non-array type, the set $M(\mathtt{X})$ is empty.

A class definition introduces a new type.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct X { int a; };
struct Y { int a; };
X a1;
Y a2;
int a3;

declares three variables of three different types. This implies that

a1 = a3;                        // error: \tcode{int} assigned to \tcode{X}
\end{codeblock}
are type mismatches, and that
\begin{codeblock}
int f(X);
int f(Y);
\end{codeblock}
\indextext{overloading}%
declare overloads\iref{over} named \tcode{f} and not
simply a single function \tcode{f} twice. For the same reason,
\begin{codeblock}
struct S { int a; };
struct S { int a; };            // error: double definition
\end{codeblock}
is ill-formed because it defines \tcode{S} twice.

It can be necessary to use an \grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier}

that belongs to a scope in which its name is also bound to
a variable, function, or enumerator\iref{basic.lookup.elab}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct stat {

stat gstat;                     // use plain \tcode{stat} to define variable

int stat(struct stat*);         // \tcode{stat} now also names a function

\indextext{class name!elaborated}%
\indextext{declaration!forward class}%
An \grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier} can also be used to declare
an \grammarterm{identifier} as a \grammarterm{class-name}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct s { int a; };

void g() {

  struct s;                     // redeclaration, has no effect
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
Such declarations allow definition of classes that refer to each other.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
class Vector;

class Matrix {
  // ...
  friend Vector operator*(const Matrix&, const Vector&);
};

class Vector {
  // ...

An \grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier}\iref{dcl.type.elab} can also
be used as a \grammarterm{type-specifier} as part of a declaration. It

an existing class of the given name.
\end{note}
\begin{example}

The declaration of a class name takes effect immediately after the
\grammarterm{identifier} is seen in the class definition or
\grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier}. For example,
\begin{codeblock}
class A * A;
\end{codeblock}
first specifies \tcode{A} to be the name of a class and then redefines
it as the name of a pointer to an object of that class. This means that
the elaborated form \keyword{class} \tcode{A} must be used to refer to the

At the point of definition of a virtual destructor (including an implicit
definition), the non-array deallocation function is
determined as if for the expression \tcode{delete this} appearing in a
non-virtual destructor of the destructor's class (see~\ref{expr.delete}).
If the lookup fails or if the deallocation function has
a deleted definition\iref{dcl.fct.def}, the program is ill-formed.
\begin{note}
This assures that a deallocation function corresponding to the dynamic type of an
object is available for the
\grammarterm{delete-expression}\iref{class.free}.

\pnum
\indextext{destructor!explicit call}%
In an explicit destructor call, the destructor is specified by a
\tcode{\~{}}
followed by a
\grammarterm{type-name} or \grammarterm{decltype-specifier}
that denotes the destructor's class type.
The invocation of a destructor is subject to the usual rules for member
functions\iref{class.mfct};
that is, if the object is not of the destructor's class type and
not of a class derived from the destructor's class type (including when
the destructor is invoked via a null pointer value), the program has
undefined behavior.
\begin{note}
Invoking \keyword{delete} on a null pointer does not call the
destructor; see \ref{expr.delete}.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct B {
  virtual ~B() { }
};
struct D : B {
  ~D() { }
};

D D_object;
typedef B B_alias;
B* B_ptr = &D_object;

void f() {
  D_object.B::~B();             // calls \tcode{B}'s destructor
  B_ptr->~B();                  // calls \tcode{D}'s destructor
  B_ptr->~B_alias();            // calls \tcode{D}'s destructor
  B_ptr->B_alias::~B();         // calls \tcode{B}'s destructor
  B_ptr->B_alias::~B_alias();   // calls \tcode{B}'s destructor

\begin{note}
An explicit destructor call must always be written using
a member access operator\iref{expr.ref} or a \grammarterm{qualified-id}\iref{expr.prim.id.qual};
in particular, the
\grammarterm{unary-expression}
\tcode{\~{}X()}

\begin{note}
\indextext{object!destructor and placement of}%
Explicit calls of destructors are rarely needed.
One use of such calls is for objects placed at specific
addresses using a placement
\grammarterm{new-expression}.
Such use of explicit placement and destruction of objects can be necessary
to cope with dedicated hardware resources and for writing memory management
facilities.
For example,
\begin{codeblock}
void* operator new(std::size_t, void* p) { return p; }
struct X {
  X(int);
  ~X();
};
void f(X* p);

void g() {                      // rare, specialized use:
  char* buf = new char[sizeof(X)];
  X* p = new(buf) X(222);       // use \tcode{buf[]} and initialize
  f(p);
  p->X::~X();                   // cleanup
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{note}

\pnum
Once a destructor is invoked for an object, the object's lifetime ends;
the behavior is undefined if the destructor is invoked
for an object whose lifetime has ended\iref{basic.life}.
\begin{example}
If the destructor for an object with automatic storage duration is explicitly invoked,
and the block is subsequently left in a manner that would ordinarily
invoke implicit destruction of the object, the behavior is undefined.
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
\indextext{fundamental type!destructor and}%
The notation for explicit call of a destructor can be used for any scalar type
name\iref{expr.prim.id.dtor}.
Allowing this makes it possible to write code without having to know if a
destructor exists for a given type.
For example:
\begin{codeblock}
typedef int I;
I* p;
p->I::~I();
\end{codeblock}

to a (possibly cv-qualified) base class of that type (or a reference to it),
or to \cv{}~\keyword{void}.
\begin{footnote}
These conversions are considered
as standard conversions for the purposes of overload resolution~(\ref{over.best.ics}, \ref{over.ics.ref}) and therefore initialization\iref{dcl.init} and explicit casts\iref{expr.static.cast}. A conversion to \keyword{void} does not invoke any conversion function\iref{expr.static.cast}.
Even though never directly called to perform a conversion,
such conversion functions can be declared and can potentially
be reached through a call to a virtual conversion function in a base class.

a non-static data member is \defnx{active}{active!union member}
if its name refers to an object
whose lifetime has begun and has not ended\iref{basic.life}.
At most one of the non-static data members of an object of union type
can be active at any
time, that is, the value of at most one of the non-static data members can be
stored in a union at any time.
\begin{note}
One special guarantee is made in order to
simplify the use of unions: If a standard-layout union contains several standard-layout
structs that share a common initial sequence\iref{class.mem}, and
if a non-static data member of an object of this standard-layout union type
is active and is one of the standard-layout structs,
it is permitted to inspect the common initial sequence
of any of the standard-layout struct members;
see~\ref{class.mem}.
\end{note}

\pnum
The size of a union is sufficient to contain the largest
of its non-static data members. Each non-static data member is allocated
as if it were the sole member of a non-union class.
\begin{note}
A union object and its non-static data members are
pointer-interconvertible~(\ref{basic.compound}, \ref{expr.static.cast}).
As a consequence, all non-static data members of a
union object have the same address.
\end{note}

A union can have member functions (including constructors and destructors),
\indextext{restriction!\idxcode{union}}%
but it shall not have virtual\iref{class.virtual} functions. A union shall not have
base classes. A union shall not be used as a base class.
\indextext{restriction!\idxcode{union}}%
If a union contains a non-static data member of
reference type the program is ill-formed.
\begin{note}
Absent default member initializers\iref{class.mem},
if any non-static data member of a union has a non-trivial
default constructor\iref{class.default.ctor},
copy constructor, move constructor\iref{class.copy.ctor},
copy assignment operator, move assignment operator\iref{class.copy.assign},
or destructor\iref{class.dtor}, the corresponding member function
of the union must be user-provided or it will
be implicitly deleted\iref{dcl.fct.def.delete} for the union.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{example}
Consider the following union:

\begin{codeblock}
union U {
  int i;
  float f;
  std::string s;
};
\end{codeblock}

Since \tcode{std::string}\iref{string.classes} declares non-trivial versions of all of the special
member functions, \tcode{U} will have an implicitly deleted default constructor,
copy/move constructor,
copy/move assignment operator, and destructor.
To use \tcode{U}, some or all of these member functions
must be user-provided.
\end{example}

\pnum
When the left operand of an assignment operator
involves a member access expression\iref{expr.ref}
that nominates a union member,
it may begin the lifetime of that union member,
as described below.
For an expression \tcode{E},
define the set $S(\mathtt{E})$
of subexpressions of \tcode{E}
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
If \tcode{E} is of the form \tcode{A.B},
$S(\mathtt{E})$ contains the elements of $S(\mathtt{A})$,
and also contains \tcode{A.B}
if \tcode{B} names a union member of a non-class, non-array type,
or of a class type with a trivial default constructor that is not deleted,
or an array of such types.
\item
If \tcode{E} is of the form \tcode{A[B]}
and is interpreted as a built-in array subscripting operator,
$S(\mathtt{E})$ is $S(\mathtt{A})$ if \tcode{A} is of array type,
$S(\mathtt{B})$ if \tcode{B} is of array type,
and empty otherwise.
\item
Otherwise, $S(\mathtt{E})$ is empty.
\end{itemize}
In an assignment expression of the form \tcode{E1 = E2}
that uses either the built-in assignment operator\iref{expr.ass}
or a trivial assignment operator\iref{class.copy.assign},
for each element \tcode{X} of $S($\tcode{E1}$)$,
if modification of \tcode{X} would have undefined behavior under~\ref{basic.life},
an object of the type of \tcode{X} is implicitly created
in the nominated storage;
no initialization is performed and
the beginning of its lifetime is sequenced after
the value computation of the left and right operands
and before the assignment.
\begin{note}
This ends the lifetime of the previously-active
member of the union, if any\iref{basic.life}.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
union A { int x; int y[4]; };
struct B { A a; };

struct X { const int a; int b; };
union Y { X x; int k; };

  int n = y.x.a;
  y.k = 4;              // OK: ends lifetime of \tcode{y.x}, \tcode{y.k} is active member of union
  y.x.b = n;            // undefined behavior: \tcode{y.x.b} modified outside its lifetime,
                        // $S($\tcode{y.x.b}$)$ is empty because \tcode{X}'s default constructor is deleted,

In cases where the above rule does not apply,
the active member of a union can only be changed by
the use of a placement \grammarterm{new-expression}.

Consider an object \tcode{u} of a \keyword{union} type \tcode{U} having non-static data members
\tcode{m} of type \tcode{M} and \tcode{n} of type \tcode{N}. If \tcode{M} has a non-trivial
destructor and \tcode{N} has a non-trivial constructor (for instance, if they declare or inherit
virtual functions), the active member of \tcode{u} can be safely switched from \tcode{m} to
\tcode{n} using the destructor and placement \grammarterm{new-expression} as follows:

\begin{codeblock}
u.m.~M();

struct B {

struct D : B {

struct D2 : D {

\end{codeblock}
the function \tcode{f(int)} in class \tcode{D} hides the virtual
function \tcode{f()} in its base class \tcode{B}; \tcode{D::f(int)} is
not a virtual function. However, \tcode{f()} declared in class
\tcode{D2} has the same name and the same parameter list as
\tcode{B::f()}, and therefore is a virtual function that overrides the

class type \tcode{D}. When the overriding function is called as the
final overrider of the overridden function, its result is converted to
the type returned by the (statically chosen) overridden
function\iref{expr.call}.

another class.

\begin{note}
A member of a private base class can be inaccessible as inherited,
but accessible directly.
Because of the rules on pointer conversions\iref{conv.ptr} and
explicit casts~(\ref{expr.type.conv}, \ref{expr.static.cast}, \ref{expr.cast}),
a conversion from a pointer to a derived class to a pointer
to an inaccessible base class can be ill-formed if an implicit conversion
is used, but well-formed if an explicit cast is used.
For example,

\begin{codeblock}
class B {
public:
  int mi;                       // non-static member
  static int si;                // static member
};
class D : private B {
};
class DD : public D {
  void f();
};

void DD::f() {
  mi = 3;                       // error: \tcode{mi} is private in \tcode{D}
  si = 3;                       // error: \tcode{si} is private in \tcode{D}
  ::B  b;
  b.mi = 3;                     // OK (\tcode{b.mi} is different from \tcode{this->mi})
  b.si = 3;                     // OK (\tcode{b.si} is different from \tcode{this->si})
  ::B::si = 3;                  // OK
  ::B* bp1 = this;              // error: \tcode{B} is a private base class
  ::B* bp2 = (::B*)this;        // OK with cast
  bp2->mi = 3;                  // OK: access through a pointer to \tcode{B}.

\pnum
If a base class is accessible, one can implicitly convert a pointer to
a derived class to a pointer to that base class~(\ref{conv.ptr}, \ref{conv.mem}).
\begin{note}
It follows that
members and friends of a class
\tcode{X}
can implicitly convert an
\tcode{X*}
to a pointer to a private or protected immediate base class of
\tcode{X}.
\end{note}
The access to a member is affected by the class in which the member is
named.
This naming class is
the class in whose scope name lookup performed a search that found the member.
\begin{note}
This class can be explicit, e.g., when a
\grammarterm{qualified-id}
is used, or implicit, e.g., when a class member access operator\iref{expr.ref} is used (including cases where an implicit
``\tcode{this->}''
is
added).
If both a class member access operator and a
\grammarterm{qualified-id}
are used to name the member (as in
\tcode{p->T::m}),
the class naming the member is the class denoted by the
\grammarterm{nested-name-specifier}
of the
\grammarterm{qualified-id}
(that is,
\tcode{T}).
\end{note}

\placeholder{R}
when named in class

is public, or
\item
\tcode{m}

\tcode{P}
derived from
\tcode{N},

\tcode{m}

\tcode{B}
of
\tcode{N}
that is accessible at
\placeholder{R},
and
\tcode{m}
is accessible at
\placeholder{R}

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}

  friend void f(B*);
};
class B : public A { };
void f(B* p) {
  p->i = 1;         // OK: \tcode{B*} can be implicitly converted to \tcode{A*}, and \tcode{f} has access to \tcode{i} in \tcode{A}

\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{itemize}

\pnum
If a class member access operator, including an implicit
``\tcode{this->}'',
is used to access a non-static data member or non-static
member function, the reference is ill-formed if the
left operand (considered as a pointer in the
``\tcode{.}''
operator case) cannot be implicitly converted to a
pointer to the naming class of the right operand.
\begin{note}
This requirement is in addition to the requirement that
the member be accessible as named.

\indextext{friend function!access and}%
\indextext{access control!friend function}

\pnum
A friend of a class is a function or class that is
given permission to name the private and protected members of the class.
A class specifies its friends, if any, by way of friend declarations.
Such declarations give special access rights to the friends, but they
do not make the nominated friends members of the befriending class.
\begin{example}
The following example illustrates the differences between
members and friends:
\indextext{friend function!member function and}%

\begin{codeblock}
class X {
  int a;
  friend void friend_set(X*, int);
public:
  void member_set(int);
};

void friend_set(X* p, int i) { p->a = i; }
void X::member_set(int i) { a = i; }

  friend_set(&obj,10);
  obj.member_set(10);

\indextext{friend!class access and}%
Declaring a class to be a friend implies that private and
protected members of the class granting friendship can be named in the
\grammarterm{base-specifier}{s} and member declarations of the befriended

class A {
  class B { };
  friend class X;

  class Y {
    A::B my;                    // OK: \tcode{A::B} accessible to nested member of friend

A friend declaration can be the
\grammarterm{declaration} in a \grammarterm{template-declaration}
(\ref{temp.pre}, \ref{temp.friend}).
\end{note}
If the
type specifier in a \keyword{friend} declaration designates a (possibly
cv-qualified) class type, that class is declared as a friend; otherwise, the
friend declaration is ignored.

An additional access check beyond those described earlier in \ref{class.access}

\begin{footnote}
This
additional check does not apply to other members,
e.g., static data members or enumerator member constants.

As described earlier, access to a protected member is granted because the
reference occurs in a friend or direct member of some class \tcode{C}. If the access is
to form a pointer to member\iref{expr.unary.op}, the
\grammarterm{nested-name-specifier} shall denote \tcode{C} or a class derived from
\tcode{C}. All other accesses involve a (possibly implicit) object
expression\iref{expr.ref}. In this case, the class of the object expression shall be
\tcode{C} or a class derived from \tcode{C}.

Member functions, including virtual functions\iref{class.virtual}, can be called
during construction or destruction\iref{class.base.init}.
When a virtual function is called directly or indirectly from a constructor
or from a destructor,
including during the construction or destruction of the class's non-static data
members,
and the object to which the call applies is the object (call it \tcode{x}) under construction or
destruction,
the function called is the
final overrider in the constructor's or destructor's class and not one
overriding it in a more-derived class.
If the virtual function call uses an explicit class member access\iref{expr.ref}
and the object expression refers to
the complete object of \tcode{x} or one of that object's base class subobjects
but not \tcode{x} or one of its base class subobjects, the behavior

otherwise, the destruction occurs at the later of the times when the

Because only one object is destroyed instead of two,

is permitted in the
following circumstances (which may be combined to
eliminate multiple copies):
\begin{itemize}
\item in a \tcode{return} statement in a function with a class return type,
when the \grammarterm{expression} is the name of a non-volatile
object with automatic storage duration (other than a function parameter or a variable
introduced by the \grammarterm{exception-declaration} of a
\grammarterm{handler}\iref{except.handle})
with the same type (ignoring cv-qualification) as
the function return type, the copy/move operation can be
omitted by constructing the object directly
into the function call's return object

\item in a \grammarterm{throw-expression}\iref{expr.throw}, when the operand
is the name of a non-volatile object with automatic storage duration
(other than a function or catch-clause parameter)
that belongs to a scope that does not contain
the innermost enclosing \grammarterm{compound-statement}
associated with a \grammarterm{try-block} (if there is one),
the copy/move operation can be omitted by
constructing the object directly into the exception object

\item in a coroutine\iref{dcl.fct.def.coroutine}, a copy of a coroutine parameter
can be omitted and references to that copy replaced with references to the
corresponding parameter if the meaning of the program will be unchanged except for
the execution of a constructor and destructor for the parameter copy object

\item when the \grammarterm{exception-declaration} of an
exception handler\iref{except.pre} declares an object of the same
type (except for cv-qualification) as the exception
object\iref{except.throw}, the copy operation can be omitted by treating
the \grammarterm{exception-declaration} as an alias for the exception
object if the meaning of the program will be unchanged except for the execution
of constructors and destructors for the object declared by the
\grammarterm{exception-declaration}.
\begin{note}
There cannot be a move from the exception object because it is
always an lvalue.
\end{note}
\end{itemize}
Copy elision is not permitted
where an expression is evaluated in a context
requiring a constant expression\iref{expr.const}
and in constant initialization\iref{basic.start.static}.
\begin{note}
It is possible that copy elision is performed
if the same expression
is evaluated in another context.

Here the criteria for elision can eliminate
the copying of the object \tcode{t} with automatic storage duration
into the result object for the function call \tcode{f()},
which is the non-local object \tcode{t2}.
Effectively, the construction of \tcode{t}
can be viewed as directly initializing \tcode{t2},
and that object's destruction will occur at program exit.
Adding a move constructor to \tcode{Thing} has the same effect, but it is the
move construction from the object with automatic storage duration to \tcode{t2} that is elided.

An \defnadj{implicitly movable}{entity} is
a variable of automatic storage duration
that is either a non-volatile object or

\begin{itemize}
\item If the \grammarterm{expression} in a \tcode{return}\iref{stmt.return} or
\tcode{co_return}\iref{stmt.return.coroutine} statement
is a (possibly parenthesized) \grammarterm{id-expression}

or \grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} of the innermost enclosing
function or \grammarterm{lambda-expression}, or

\item if the operand of a \grammarterm{throw-expression}\iref{expr.throw}
is a (possibly parenthesized) \grammarterm{id-expression}
that names an implicitly movable entity
that belongs to a scope that does not contain the \grammarterm{compound-statement}
of the innermost \grammarterm{try-block} or \grammarterm{function-try-block}
(if any)
whose \grammarterm{compound-statement} or \grammarterm{ctor-initializer}
contains the \grammarterm{throw-expression},
\end{itemize}
overload resolution to select the constructor
for the copy or the \tcode{return_value} overload to call
is first performed as if the expression or operand were an rvalue.
If the first overload resolution fails or was not performed,
overload resolution is performed again,
considering the expression or operand as an lvalue.
\begin{note}
This two-stage overload resolution is performed regardless
of whether copy elision will occur. It determines the constructor
or the \tcode{return_value} overload to be called if
elision is not performed, and the selected constructor
or \tcode{return_value} overload must be accessible even if
the call is elided.

for a secondary comparison operator \tcode{@}
shall have a declared return type \tcode{bool}.

\pnum
The operator function with parameters \tcode{x} and \tcode{y}
is defined as deleted if
\begin{itemize}
\item
overload resolution\iref{over.match},
as applied to \tcode{x @ y},
does not result in a usable candidate, or

\item
the candidate selected by overload resolution
is not a rewritten candidate.
\end{itemize}

Otherwise, the operator function yields \tcode{x @ y}.
The defaulted operator function is not considered as a candidate
in the overload resolution for the \tcode{@} operator.

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct HasNoLessThan { };

struct C {
  friend HasNoLessThan operator<=>(const C&, const C&);
  bool operator<(const C&) const = default;             // OK, function is deleted
};
\end{codeblock}

Any allocation function for a class
\tcode{T}
is a static member (even if not explicitly declared
\keyword{static}).

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
class Arena;
struct B {
  void* operator new(std::size_t, Arena*);
};
struct D1 : B {
};

Arena*  ap;
void foo(int i) {
  new (ap) D1;      // calls \tcode{B::operator new(std::size_t, Arena*)}
  new D1[i];        // calls \tcode{::operator new[](std::size_t)}
  new D1;           // error: \tcode{::operator new(std::size_t)} hidden
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\indextext{\idxcode{delete}!type of}%
Any deallocation function for a class
\tcode{X}
is a static member (even if not explicitly declared
\keyword{static}).
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
class X {
  void operator delete(void*);
  void operator delete[](void*, std::size_t);
};

class Y {
  void operator delete(void*, std::size_t);
  void operator delete[](void*);
};
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
Since member allocation and deallocation functions are
\keyword{static}
they cannot be virtual.
\begin{note}
However, when the
\grammarterm{cast-expression}
of a
\grammarterm{delete-expression}
refers to an object of class type with a virtual destructor,
because the deallocation function is chosen by the destructor
of the dynamic type of the object, the effect is the same in that case.
For example,
\begin{codeblock}
struct B {
  virtual ~B();
  void operator delete(void*, std::size_t);
};

struct D : B {
  void operator delete(void*);
};

struct E : B {
  void log_deletion();
  void operator delete(E *p, std::destroying_delete_t) {
    p->log_deletion();
    p->~E();
    ::operator delete(p);
  }
};

void f() {
  B* bp = new D;
  delete bp;        // 1: uses \tcode{D::operator delete(void*)}
  bp = new E;
  delete bp;        // 2: uses \tcode{E::operator delete(E*, std::destroying_delete_t)}
}
\end{codeblock}
Here, storage for the object of class
\tcode{D}
is deallocated by
\tcode{D::operator delete()},
and
the object of class \tcode{E} is destroyed
and its storage is deallocated
by \tcode{E::operator delete()},
due to the virtual destructor.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
Virtual destructors have no effect on the deallocation function actually
called when the
\grammarterm{cast-expression}
of a
\grammarterm{delete-expression}
refers to an array of objects of class type.
For example,
\begin{codeblock}
struct B {
  virtual ~B();
  void operator delete[](void*, std::size_t);
};

struct D : B {
  void operator delete[](void*, std::size_t);
};

void f(int i) {
  D* dp = new D[i];
  delete [] dp;     // uses \tcode{D::operator delete[](void*, std::size_t)}
  B* bp = new D[i];
  delete[] bp;      // undefined behavior
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{note}

\pnum
Access to the deallocation function is checked statically,
even if a different one is actually executed.
\begin{example}
For the call on line ``// 1'' above,
if
\tcode{B::operator delete()}
had been private, the delete expression would have been ill-formed.
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
If a deallocation function has no explicit \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier}, it
has a non-throwing exception specification\iref{except.spec}.
\end{note}
