a function type. The resulting member function has exactly the same type
as it would have if the function declarator were provided explicitly,

enclosing the definition of class \tcode{X}.

\pnum
\indextext{friend~function!nested~class}%
Like a member function, a friend function~(\ref{class.friend}) defined
within a nested class is in the lexical scope of that class; it obeys
the same rules for name binding as a static member function of that
class~(\ref{class.static}), but it has no special access rights to
members of an enclosing class.

\rSec1[class.local]{Local class declarations}
\indextext{declaration!local~class}%
\indextext{definition!local~class}%

\pnum
A class can be declared within a function definition; such a class is
called a \grammarterm{local} class. The name of a local class is local to
its enclosing scope.
\indextext{local~class!scope~of}%
The local class is in the scope of the enclosing scope, and has the same
access to names outside the function as does the enclosing function.
Declarations in a local class
shall not odr-use~(\ref{basic.def.odr}) a variable with automatic storage
duration from an
enclosing scope.

\pnum
An enclosing function has no special access to members of the local
class; it obeys the usual access rules (Clause~\ref{class.access}).
\indextext{member function!local~class}%
Member functions of a local class shall be defined within their class
definition, if they are defined at all.

\pnum
\indextext{nested~class!local~class}%
If class \tcode{X} is a local class a nested class \tcode{Y} may be
declared in class \tcode{X} and later defined in the definition of class
\tcode{X} or be later defined in the same scope as the definition of
class \tcode{X}.
\indextext{restriction!local~class}%
A class nested within
a local class is a local class.

\pnum
A local class shall not have static data members.

\rSec1[class.nested.type]{Nested type names}
\indextext{type~name!nested}%

\pnum
Type names obey exactly the same scope rules as other names. In
particular, type names defined within a class definition cannot be used
outside their class without qualification.
