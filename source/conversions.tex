\indextext{conversion!implicit}%
Standard conversions are implicit conversions with built-in meaning.
Clause~\ref{conv} enumerates the full set of such conversions. A
\indextext{sequence!standard conversion}%
\term{standard conversion sequence} is a sequence of standard
conversions in the following order:

\begin{itemize}
\item Zero or one conversion from the following set: lvalue-to-rvalue
conversion, array-to-pointer conversion, and function-to-pointer
conversion.

\item Zero or one conversion from the following set: integral
promotions, floating point promotion, integral conversions, floating
point conversions, floating-integral conversions, pointer conversions,
pointer to member conversions, and boolean conversions.

\item Zero or one function pointer conversion.

\item Zero or one qualification conversion.
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}
A standard conversion sequence can be empty, i.e., it can consist of no
conversions. \end{note} A standard conversion sequence will be applied to
an expression if necessary to convert it to a required destination type.

\pnum
\begin{note} 
expressions with a given type will be implicitly converted to other
types in several contexts:

\begin{itemize}
\item When used as operands of operators. The operator's requirements
for its operands dictate the destination type (Clause~\ref{expr}).

\item When used in the condition of an \tcode{if} statement or iteration
statement~(\ref{stmt.select}, \ref{stmt.iter}). The destination type is
\tcode{bool}.

\item When used in the expression of a \tcode{switch} statement. The
destination type is integral~(\ref{stmt.select}).

\item When used as the source expression for an initialization (which
includes use as an argument in a function call and use as the expression
in a \tcode{return} statement). The type of the entity being initialized
is (generally) the destination type.
See~\ref{dcl.init},~\ref{dcl.init.ref}.
\end{itemize}
\end{note} 

\pnum
An expression \tcode{e} can be
\indextext{conversion!implicit}%
\term{implicitly converted} to a type \tcode{T} if and only if the
declaration \tcode{T t=e;} is well-formed, for some invented temporary
variable \tcode{t}~(\ref{dcl.init}).

\pnum
Certain language constructs require that an expression be converted to a Boolean
value. An expression \tcode{e} appearing in such a context is said to be
\indextext{conversion!contextual to \tcode{bool}}%
\term{contextually converted to \tcode{bool}} and is well-formed if and only if
the declaration \tcode{bool t(e);} is well-formed, for some invented temporary
variable \tcode{t}~(\ref{dcl.init}).

\pnum
Certain language constructs require conversion to a value having
one of a specified set of types appropriate to the construct. An
expression \tcode{e} of class type \tcode{E} appearing in such a
context is said to be
\indextext{conversion!contextual}%
\defn{contextually implicitly converted} to a specified type \tcode{T} and is
well-formed if and only if \tcode{e} can be implicitly converted to a type \tcode{T}
that is determined as follows:
\tcode{E} is searched for non-explicit conversion functions
whose return type is \cvqual{cv} \tcode{T} or reference to \cvqual{cv}
\tcode{T} such that \tcode{T} is allowed by the context.
There shall be exactly one such \tcode{T}.

\pnum
The effect of any implicit
conversion is the same as performing the corresponding declaration and initialization
and then using the temporary variable as the result of the conversion.
The result is an lvalue if \tcode{T} is an lvalue reference
type or an rvalue reference to function type~(\ref{dcl.ref}),
an xvalue if \tcode{T} is an rvalue reference to object type,
and a prvalue otherwise. The expression \tcode{e}
is used as a glvalue if and only if the initialization uses it as a glvalue.

\pnum
\begin{note} 
For class types, user-defined conversions are considered as well;
see~\ref{class.conv}. In general, an implicit conversion
sequence~(\ref{over.best.ics}) consists of a standard conversion
sequence followed by a user-defined conversion followed by another
standard conversion sequence.
\end{note} 

\pnum
\begin{note} 
There are some contexts where certain conversions are suppressed. For
example, the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is not done on the operand of
the unary \tcode{\&} operator. Specific exceptions are given in the
descriptions of those operators and contexts.
\end{note} 

\rSec1[conv.lval]{Lvalue-to-rvalue conversion}

\pnum
\indextext{conversion!lvalue-to-rvalue}%
\indextext{type!incomplete}%
A glvalue~(\ref{basic.lval}) of a non-function, non-array type \tcode{T}
can be converted to
a prvalue.\footnote{For historical reasons, this conversion is called the ``lvalue-to-rvalue''
conversion, even though that name does not accurately reflect the taxonomy
of expressions described in~\ref{basic.lval}.}
If \tcode{T} is an incomplete type, a
program that necessitates this conversion is ill-formed. If \tcode{T}
is a non-class type, the type of the prvalue is
the cv-unqualified version of \tcode{T}. Otherwise, the type of the
prvalue is \tcode{T}.\footnote{In \Cpp class prvalues can have cv-qualified types (because they are
objects). This differs from ISO C, in which non-lvalues never have
cv-qualified types.}

\pnum
When an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion
is applied to an expression \tcode{e}, and either
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{e} is not potentially evaluated, or
\item the evaluation of \tcode{e} results in the evaluation of a member
      \tcode{ex} of the set of potential results of \tcode{e}, and \tcode{ex}
      names a variable \tcode{x} that is not odr-used by
      \tcode{ex}~(\ref{basic.def.odr}),
\end{itemize}
the value contained in the referenced object is not accessed.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S { int n; };
auto f() {
  S x { 1 };
  constexpr S y { 2 };
  return [&](bool b) { return (b ? y : x).n; };
}
auto g = f();
int m = g(false); // undefined behavior due to access of \tcode{x.n} outside its lifetime
int n = g(true);  // OK, does not access \tcode{y.n}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
In all other cases, the result of the conversion is determined according to the
following rules:

\begin{itemize}

\item If \tcode{T} is (possibly cv-qualified) \tcode{std::nullptr_t}, the result is a
null pointer constant~(\ref{conv.ptr}).
\begin{note} 
Since no value is fetched from memory,
there is no side effect for a volatile access~(\ref{intro.execution}), and
an inactive member of a union~(\ref{class.union}) may be accessed.
\end{note} 

\item Otherwise, if \tcode{T} has a class
type, the conversion copy-initializes a temporary of type \tcode{T} from
the glvalue and the result of the conversion is a prvalue for the
temporary.

\item Otherwise, if the object to which the glvalue refers contains an invalid
pointer value~(\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation},
\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.safety}), the behavior is implementation-defined.

\item Otherwise, the value contained in the object indicated by the
glvalue is the prvalue result.

``pointer to \tcode{T}''. The result is a pointer to the first element
of the array.

\indextext{conversion!function-to-pointer}%
An lvalue of function type \tcode{T} can be converted to a prvalue of

lvalue that refers to a non-static member function cannot be obtained.}

If $P_i$ designates an array,
the cv-qualifiers $cv_{i+1}$ on the element type are also taken as
the cv-qualifiers $cv_i$ of the array.

The type denoted by the \grammarterm{type-id} \tcode{const int **}
has two cv-decompositions,
taking \tcode{U} as ``\tcode{int}'' and as ``pointer to \tcode{const int}''.
\end{example}
The \placeholder{n}-tuple of cv-qualifiers after the first one
in the longest cv-decomposition of \tcode{T}, that is,
$cv_1$, $cv_2$, $\cdots$, $cv_n$, is called the

if a program could assign a pointer of type \tcode{T**} to a pointer of
type \tcode{const} \tcode{T**} (that is, if line \tcode{\#1} below were

converted to a pointer type; the
result is the \term{null pointer value} of that type and is
distinguishable from every other value of
object pointer or function pointer
type.
Such a conversion is called a \term{null pointer conversion}.
Two null pointer values of the same type shall compare
equal. The conversion of a null pointer constant to a pointer to
cv-qualified type is a single conversion, and not the sequence of a
pointer conversion followed by a qualification
conversion~(\ref{conv.qual}). A null pointer constant of integral type

non-null pointer value of a pointer to object type to a ``pointer to
\cvqual{cv} \tcode{void}''

inaccessible (Clause~\ref{class.access}) or
ambiguous~(\ref{class.member.lookup}) base class of \tcode{D}, a program

Such a conversion is called a \term{null member pointer conversion}.
Two null member pointer values of
the same type shall compare equal. The conversion of a null pointer
constant to a pointer to member of cv-qualified type is a single
conversion, and not the sequence of a pointer to member conversion

ambiguous~(\ref{class.member.lookup}), or virtual~(\ref{class.mi}) base
class of \tcode{D}, or a base class of a virtual base class of
\tcode{D}, a program that necessitates this conversion is ill-formed.
The result of the conversion refers to the same member as the pointer to
member before the conversion took place, but it refers to the base class
member as if it were a member of the derived class. The result refers to
the member in \tcode{D}'s instance of \tcode{B}. Since the result has
type ``pointer to member of \tcode{D} of type \cvqual{cv} \tcode{T}'',
indirection through it with a \tcode{D} object is valid. The result is the same
as if indirecting through the pointer to member of \tcode{B} with the
\tcode{B} subobject of \tcode{D}. The null member pointer value is
converted to the null member pointer value of the destination
type.\footnote{The rule for conversion of pointers to members (from pointer to member
of base to pointer to member of derived) appears inverted compared to
the rule for pointers to objects (from pointer to derived to pointer to
base)~(\ref{conv.ptr}, Clause~\ref{class.derived}). This inversion is
necessary to ensure type safety. Note that a pointer to member is not
an object pointer or a function pointer
