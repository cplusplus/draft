Exception handling provides a way of transferring control and information
from a point in the execution of a thread to an exception handler
associated with a point previously passed by the execution.
A handler will be invoked only by throwing an exception
in code executed in the handler's try block
or in functions called from the handler's try block.

a try block or handler.
When this happens, each variable declared in the try block
will be destroyed in the context that

\begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
lab:  try {

\tcode{goto lab;}

Throwing an exception transfers control to a handler.
\begin{note}
An exception can be thrown from one of the following contexts:
\grammarterm{throw-expression}{s}~(\ref{expr.throw}),
allocation functions~(\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.allocation}),
\tcode{dynamic_cast}~(\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}),
\tcode{typeid}~(\ref{expr.typeid}),
\grammarterm{new-expression}{s}~(\ref{expr.new}), and standard library
functions~(\ref{structure.specifications}).
\end{note}
An object is passed and the type of that object determines which handlers
can catch it.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
throw "Help!";
\end{codeblock}
can be caught by a
\grammarterm{handler}
of
\tcode{const}
\tcode{char*}
type:
\begin{codeblock}
try {
    // ...
} catch(const char* p) {
    // handle character string exceptions here
}
\end{codeblock}
and
\begin{codeblock}
class Overflow {
public:
    Overflow(char,double,double);
};

void f(double x) {
    throw Overflow('+',x,3.45e107);

\tcode{Overflow}:
\begin{codeblock}

Throwing an exception
copy-initializes~(\ref{dcl.init}, \ref{class.copy}) a temporary object,
called the
\defnx{exception object}{exception handling!exception object}.
An lvalue denoting the temporary is used to initialize the
variable declared in the matching
\grammarterm{handler}~(\ref{except.handle}).
If the type of the exception object would
be an incomplete type or a pointer to an incomplete
type other than \cv{}~\tcode{void} the program is ill-formed.

The memory for the exception object is
allocated in an unspecified way, except as noted in~\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.allocation}.
If a handler exits by rethrowing, control is passed to another handler for
the same exception object.
The points of potential destruction for the exception object are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
when an active handler for the exception exits by
any means other than
rethrowing,
immediately after the destruction of the object (if any)
declared in the \grammarterm{exception-declaration} in the handler;

\item
when an object of type \tcode{std::exception_ptr}~(\ref{propagation})
that refers to the exception object is destroyed,
before the destructor of \tcode{std::exception_ptr} returns.
\end{itemize}

Among all points of potential destruction for the exception object,
there is an unspecified last one
where the exception object is destroyed.
All other points happen before that last one~(\ref{intro.races}).
\begin{note}
No other thread synchronization is implied in exception handling.
\end{note}
The implementation may then
deallocate the memory for the exception object; any such deallocation
is done in an unspecified way.
\begin{note} A thrown exception does not
propagate to other threads unless caught, stored, and rethrown using
appropriate library functions; see~\ref{propagation} and~\ref{futures}. \end{note}

a copy-initialization considering the thrown object as an lvalue
shall be non-deleted and accessible, even if the copy/move operation is
elided~(\ref{class.copy}).
The destructor is potentially invoked~(\ref{class.dtor}).

\pnum
\indextext{exception handling!rethrow}%
\indextext{rethrow|see{exception handling, rethrow}}%

As control passes from the point where an exception is thrown

destructors are invoked by a process, specified in this section, called
\defn{stack unwinding}.

\pnum
The destructor is invoked for each automatic object of class type constructed,
but not yet destroyed,
since the try block was entered.
If an exception is thrown during the destruction of temporaries or
local variables for a \tcode{return} statement~(\ref{stmt.return}),
the destructor for the returned object (if any) is also invoked.
The objects are destroyed in the reverse order of the completion
of their construction.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A { };

struct Y { ~Y() noexcept(false) { throw 0; } };

A f() {
  try {

    Y y;
    A b;
    return {};      // \#1
  } catch (...) {
  }
  return {};        // \#2
}
\end{codeblock}
At \#1, the returned object of type \tcode{A} is constructed.
Then, the local variable \tcode{b} is destroyed~(\ref{stmt.jump}).
Next, the local variable \tcode{y} is destroyed,
causing stack unwinding,
resulting in the destruction of the returned object,
followed by the destruction of the local variable \tcode{a}.
Finally, the returned object is constructed again at \#2.
\end{example}

\pnum
If the initialization or destruction of an object
other than by delegating constructor
is terminated by an exception,
the destructor is invoked for
each of the object's direct subobjects
and, for a complete object, virtual base class subobjects,
whose initialization has completed~(\ref{dcl.init})
and whose destructor has not yet begun execution,
except that in the case of destruction, the variant members of a
union-like class are not destroyed.
The subobjects are destroyed in the reverse order of the completion of
their construction. Such destruction is sequenced before entering a
handler of the \grammarterm{function-try-block} of the constructor or destructor,
if any.

\pnum
If the \grammarterm{compound-statement}

\tcode{e} is a \tcode{dynamic_cast} expression that casts to a reference type and

\tcode{e} is a \tcode{typeid} expression applied to a

An implicitly-declared constructor for a class \tcode{X},
or a constructor without a \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier}
that is defaulted on its first declaration,
has a potentially-throwing exception specification
if and only if
any of the following constructs is potentially-throwing:

\begin{itemize}
\item
a constructor selected by overload resolution
in the implicit definition of the constructor
for class \tcode{X}
to initialize a potentially constructed subobject, or
\item
a subexpression of such an initialization,
such as a default argument expression, or,
\item
for a default constructor, a default member initializer.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
Even though destructors for fully-constructed subobjects
are invoked when an exception is thrown
during the execution of a constructor~(\ref{except.ctor}),
their exception specifications do not contribute
to the exception specification of the constructor,
because an exception thrown from such a destructor
would call \tcode{std::terminate}
rather than escape the constructor~(\ref{except.throw}, \ref{except.terminate}).
\end{note}

\pnum
The exception specification for an implicitly-declared destructor,
or a destructor without a \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier},
is potentially-throwing if and only if
any of the destructors
for any of its potentially constructed subobjects
is potentially throwing.

\pnum
The exception specification for an implicitly-declared assignment operator,
or an assignment-operator without a \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier}
that is defaulted on its first declaration,
is potentially-throwing if and only if
the invocation of any assignment operator
in the implicit definition is potentially-throwing.

\pnum
A deallocation function~(\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation})
with no explicit \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier}
has a non-throwing exception specification.

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A {
  A(int = (A(5), 0)) noexcept;
  A(const A&) noexcept;
  A(A&&) noexcept;
  ~A();
};
struct B {
  B() throw();
  B(const B&) = default;        // implicit exception specification is \tcode{noexcept(true)}
  B(B&&, int = (throw Y(), 0)) noexcept;
  ~B() noexcept(false);
};
int n = 7;
struct D : public A, public B {
    int * p = new int[n];
    // \tcode{D::D()} potentially-throwing, as the \tcode{new} operator may throw \tcode{bad_alloc} or \tcode{bad_array_new_length}
    // \tcode{D::D(const D\&)} non-throwing
    // \tcode{D::D(D\&\&)} potentially-throwing, as the default argument for \tcode{B}'s constructor may throw
    // \tcode{D::\~D()} potentially-throwing
};
\end{codeblock}
Furthermore, if
\tcode{A::\~{}A()}
were virtual,
the program would be ill-formed since a function that overrides a virtual
function from a base class
shall not have a potentially-throwing exception specification
if the base class function has a non-throwing exception specification.
\end{example}

\pnum
An exception specification is considered to be \defnx{needed}{needed!exception specification} when:

\begin{itemize}
\item in an expression, the function is the unique lookup result or the selected
member of a set of overloaded functions~(\ref{basic.lookup}, \ref{over.match}, \ref{over.over});

\item the function is odr-used~(\ref{basic.def.odr}) or, if it appears in an
unevaluated operand, would be odr-used if the expression were
potentially-evaluated;

\item the exception specification is compared to that of another
declaration (e.g., an explicit specialization or an overriding virtual
function);

\item the function is defined; or

\item the exception specification is needed for a defaulted
special member function that calls the function.
\begin{note} A defaulted declaration does not require the
exception specification of a base member function to be evaluated
until the implicit exception specification of the derived
function is needed, but an explicit \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier} needs
the implicit exception specification to compare against.
\end{note}
\end{itemize}
The exception specification of a defaulted special member
function is evaluated as described above only when needed; similarly, the
\grammarterm{noexcept-specifier} of a specialization of a function
template or member function of a class template is instantiated only when
needed.

behavior~(\ref{execpol.seq}, \ref{execpol.par}, \ref{execpol.parunseq}),
when execution of an element access function~(\ref{algorithms.parallel.defns})
of the parallel algorithm exits via an exception~(\ref{algorithms.parallel.exceptions}), or

when the destructor or the copy assignment operator is invoked on an object
of type \tcode{std::thread} that refers to a joinable thread

In such cases,
\tcode{std::terminate()}

In the situation where no matching handler is found, it is
\impldef{stack unwinding before call to \tcode{std::terminate()}} whether or not the
stack is unwound
before
\tcode{std::terminate()}

In the situation where the search for a handler~(\ref{except.handle}) encounters the

whether the stack is unwound, unwound partially, or not unwound at all
before \tcode{std::terminate()} is called.
In all other situations, the stack shall not be unwound before
\tcode{std::terminate()}
is called.
An implementation is not permitted to finish stack unwinding
prematurely based on a determination that the unwind process
will eventually cause a call to
\tcode{std::terminate()}.

\rSec2[except.uncaught]{The \tcode{std::uncaught_exceptions()} function}%

\pnum
An exception is considered uncaught
after completing the initialization of the exception object~(\ref{except.throw})
until completing the activation of a handler for the exception~(\ref{except.handle}).
This includes stack unwinding.
If an exception is rethrown~(\ref{expr.throw}, \ref{propagation}),
it is considered uncaught from the point of rethrow
until the rethrown exception is caught.
The function \tcode{std::uncaught_exceptions()}~(\ref{uncaught.exceptions})
returns the number of uncaught exceptions in the current thread.%
