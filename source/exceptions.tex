\pnum
Exception handling provides a way of transferring control and information
from a point in the execution of a thread to an exception handler
associated with a point previously passed by the execution.
A handler will be invoked only by throwing an exception
in code executed in the handler's try block
or in functions called from the handler's try block.

A \grammarterm{try-block} is a \grammarterm{statement}\iref{stmt.pre}.

Within this Clause
``try block'' is taken to mean both \grammarterm{try-block} and
\grammarterm{function-try-block}.

The \grammarterm{compound-statement} of a try block or of a handler is a
control-flow-limited statement\iref{stmt.label}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void f() {

  try {
    goto l1;        // OK

A
\keyword{goto},
\keyword{break},
\keyword{return},
or
\keyword{continue}
statement can be used to transfer control out of
a try block or handler.
When this happens, each variable declared in the try block
will be destroyed in the context that
directly contains its declaration.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
lab:  try {
  T1 t1;
  try {
    T2 t2;
    if (@\grammarterm{condition}@)
      goto lab;
    } catch(...) { @\tcode{/* handler 2 */}@ }
  } catch(...) { @\tcode{/* handler 1 */}@ }
\end{codeblock}

Here, executing
\tcode{goto lab;}
will destroy first
\tcode{t2},
then
\tcode{t1},
assuming the
\grammarterm{condition}
does not declare a variable.
Any exception thrown while destroying
\tcode{t2}
will result in executing
\tcode{handler 2};
any exception thrown while destroying
\tcode{t1}
will result in executing
\tcode{handler 1}.

A
\grammarterm{function-try-block}
associates a
\grammarterm{handler-seq}
with the
\grammarterm{ctor-initializer},
if present, and the
\grammarterm{compound-statement}.
An exception
thrown during the execution of the
\grammarterm{compound-statement}
or, for constructors and destructors, during the initialization or
destruction, respectively, of the class's subobjects,
transfers control to a handler in a
\grammarterm{function-try-block}
in the same way as an exception thrown during the execution of a
\grammarterm{try-block}
transfers control to other handlers.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
int f(int);
class C {
  int i;
  double d;

C::C(int ii, double id)

Throwing an exception transfers control to a handler.
\begin{note}
An exception can be thrown from one of the following contexts:
\grammarterm{throw-expression}{s}\iref{expr.throw},
allocation functions\iref{basic.stc.dynamic.allocation},
\keyword{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast},
\keyword{typeid}\iref{expr.typeid},
\grammarterm{new-expression}{s}\iref{expr.new}, and standard library
functions\iref{structure.specifications}.
\end{note}
An object is passed and the type of that object determines which handlers
can catch it.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
throw "Help!";
\end{codeblock}
can be caught by a
\grammarterm{handler}
of
\keyword{const}
\tcode{\keyword{char}*}
type:
\begin{codeblock}
try {

and
\begin{codeblock}
class Overflow {
public:
    Overflow(char,double,double);
};

void f(double x) {
    throw Overflow('+',x,3.45e107);
}
\end{codeblock}
can be caught by a handler for exceptions of type
\tcode{Overflow}:
\begin{codeblock}
try {

Throwing an exception

an incomplete type\iref{basic.types.general},

The memory for the exception object is
allocated in an unspecified way, except as noted in~\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.allocation}.
If a handler exits by rethrowing, control is passed to another handler for
the same exception object.
The points of potential destruction for the exception object are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
when an active handler for the exception exits by
any means other than
rethrowing,
immediately after the destruction of the object (if any)
declared in the \grammarterm{exception-declaration} in the handler;

\item
when an object of type \tcode{std::exception_ptr}\iref{propagation}
that refers to the exception object is destroyed,
before the destructor of \tcode{std::exception_ptr} returns.
\end{itemize}

Among all points of potential destruction for the exception object,
there is an unspecified last one
where the exception object is destroyed.
All other points happen before that last one\iref{intro.races}.
\begin{note}
No other thread synchronization is implied in exception handling.
\end{note}
The implementation may then
deallocate the memory for the exception object; any such deallocation
is done in an unspecified way.

A thrown exception does not
propagate to other threads unless caught, stored, and rethrown using
appropriate library functions; see~\ref{propagation} and~\ref{futures}.

\indextext{unwinding!stack}%
As control passes from the point where an exception is thrown
to a handler,
objects are destroyed by a process,
specified in this subclause, called \defn{stack unwinding}.

\pnum
Each object with automatic storage duration is destroyed if it has been
constructed, but not yet destroyed,
since the try block was entered.
If an exception is thrown during the destruction of temporaries or
local variables for a \keyword{return} statement\iref{stmt.return},
the destructor for the returned object (if any) is also invoked.
The objects are destroyed in the reverse order of the completion
of their construction.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A { };

struct Y { ~Y() noexcept(false) { throw 0; } };

A f() {
  try {
    A a;
    Y y;
    A b;
    return {};      // \#1
  } catch (...) {
  }
  return {};        // \#2
}
\end{codeblock}
At \#1, the returned object of type \tcode{A} is constructed.
Then, the local variable \tcode{b} is destroyed\iref{stmt.jump}.
Next, the local variable \tcode{y} is destroyed,
causing stack unwinding,
resulting in the destruction of the returned object,
followed by the destruction of the local variable \tcode{a}.
Finally, the returned object is constructed again at \#2.
\end{example}

\pnum
If the initialization of an object
other than by delegating constructor
is terminated by an exception,
the destructor is invoked for
each of the object's subobjects
that were known to be initialized by the object's initialization and
whose initialization has completed\iref{dcl.init}.
\begin{note}
If such an object has a reference member
that extends the lifetime of a temporary object,
this ends the lifetime of the reference member,
so the lifetime of the temporary object is effectively not extended.
\end{note}
\indextext{subobject!initialized, known to be}%
A subobject is \defn{known to be initialized}
if it is not an anonymous union member and
its initialization is specified
\begin{itemize}
\item in \ref{class.base.init} for initialization by constructor,
\item in \ref{class.copy.ctor} for initialization by defaulted copy/move constructor,
\item in \ref{class.inhctor.init} for initialization by inherited constructor,
\item in \ref{dcl.init.aggr} for aggregate initialization,
\item in \ref{expr.prim.lambda.capture} for the initialization of
the closure object when evaluating a \grammarterm{lambda-expression},
\item in \ref{dcl.init.general} for
default-initialization, value-initialization, or direct-initialization
of an array.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
This includes virtual base class subobjects
if the initialization
is for a complete object, and
can include variant members
that were nominated explicitly by
a \grammarterm{mem-initializer} or \grammarterm{designated-initializer-clause} or
that have a default member initializer.
\end{note}
If the destructor of an object is terminated by an exception,
each destructor invocation
that would be performed after executing the body of the destructor\iref{class.dtor} and
that has not yet begun execution
is performed.
\begin{note}
This includes virtual base class subobjects if
the destructor was invoked for a complete object.
\end{note}
The subobjects are destroyed in the reverse order of the completion of
their construction. Such destruction is sequenced before entering a
handler of the \grammarterm{function-try-block} of the constructor or destructor,
if any.

\pnum
If the \grammarterm{compound-statement}
of the \grammarterm{function-body}
of a delegating constructor
for an object exits via
an exception, the object's destructor is invoked.
Such destruction is sequenced before entering a handler of the
\grammarterm{function-try-block} of a delegating constructor for that object, if any.

\pnum
\begin{note}
If the object was allocated by a \grammarterm{new-expression}\iref{expr.new},
the matching deallocation function\iref{basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation},
if any, is called to free the storage occupied by the object.

a \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier} may be specified,
but is not required.
If a \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier} is specified
in an explicit instantiation,
the exception specification shall be the same as
the exception specification of all other declarations of that function.
A diagnostic is required only if the
exception specifications are not the same
within a single translation unit.

\indextext{exception specification!virtual function and}%
If a virtual function has a
non-throwing exception specification,
all declarations, including the definition, of any function
that overrides that virtual function in any derived class
shall have a non-throwing
exception specification,
unless the overriding function is defined as deleted.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct B {
  virtual void f() noexcept;
  virtual void g();
  virtual void h() noexcept = delete;
};

struct D: B {
  void f();                     // error
  void g() noexcept;            // OK
  void h() = delete;            // OK
};
\end{codeblock}

The declaration of
\tcode{D::f}
is ill-formed because it
has a potentially-throwing exception specification,
whereas
\tcode{B::f}
has a non-throwing exception specification.
\end{example}

\pnum
An expression $E$ is
\defnx{potentially-throwing}{potentially-throwing!expression} if
\begin{itemize}
\item
$E$ is a function call\iref{expr.call}
whose \grammarterm{postfix-expression}
has a function type,
or a pointer-to-function type,
with a potentially-throwing exception specification,
or
\item
$E$ implicitly invokes a function
(such as an overloaded operator,
an allocation function in a \grammarterm{new-expression},
a constructor for a function argument,
or a destructor)
that has a potentially-throwing exception specification,
or
\item
$E$ is a \grammarterm{throw-expression}\iref{expr.throw},
or
\item
$E$ is a \keyword{dynamic_cast} expression that casts to a reference type and
requires a runtime check\iref{expr.dynamic.cast},
or
\item
$E$ is a \keyword{typeid} expression applied to a
(possibly parenthesized) built-in unary \tcode{*} operator
applied to a pointer to a
polymorphic class type\iref{expr.typeid},
or
\item
any of the immediate subexpressions\iref{intro.execution}
of $E$ is potentially-throwing.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
An implicitly-declared constructor for a class \tcode{X},
or a constructor without a \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier}
that is defaulted on its first declaration,
has a potentially-throwing exception specification
if and only if
any of the following constructs is potentially-throwing:
\begin{itemize}
\item
the invocation of a constructor selected by overload resolution
in the implicit definition of the constructor
for class \tcode{X}
to initialize a potentially constructed subobject, or
\item
a subexpression of such an initialization,
such as a default argument expression, or,
\item
for a default constructor, a default member initializer.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
Even though destructors for fully-constructed subobjects
are invoked when an exception is thrown
during the execution of a constructor\iref{except.ctor},
their exception specifications do not contribute
to the exception specification of the constructor,
because an exception thrown from such a destructor
would call the function \tcode{std::terminate}
rather than escape the constructor\iref{except.throw,except.terminate}.
\end{note}

\pnum
The exception specification for an implicitly-declared destructor,
or a destructor without a \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier},
is potentially-throwing if and only if
any of the destructors
for any of its potentially constructed subobjects
has a potentially-throwing exception specification or
the destructor is virtual and the destructor of any virtual base class
has a potentially-throwing exception specification.

\pnum
The exception specification for an implicitly-declared assignment operator,
or an assignment-operator without a \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier}
that is defaulted on its first declaration,
is potentially-throwing if and only if
the invocation of any assignment operator
in the implicit definition is potentially-throwing.

\pnum
A deallocation function\iref{basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation}
with no explicit \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier}
has a non-throwing exception specification.

\pnum
The exception specification for a comparison operator function\iref{over.binary}
without a \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier}
that is defaulted on its first declaration
is potentially-throwing if and only if
any expression
in the implicit definition is potentially-throwing.

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A {
  A(int = (A(5), 0)) noexcept;
  A(const A&) noexcept;
  A(A&&) noexcept;
  ~A();
};
struct B {
  B() noexcept;
  B(const B&) = default;        // implicit exception specification is \tcode{\keyword{noexcept}(\keyword{true})}
  B(B&&, int = (throw 42, 0)) noexcept;
  ~B() noexcept(false);
};
int n = 7;
struct D : public A, public B {
    int * p = new int[n];
    // \tcode{D::D()} potentially-throwing, as the \keyword{new} operator may throw \tcode{bad_alloc} or \tcode{bad_array_new_length}
    // \tcode{D::D(const D\&)} non-throwing
    // \tcode{D::D(D\&\&)} potentially-throwing, as the default argument for \tcode{B}'s constructor may throw
    // \tcode{D::\~D()} potentially-throwing
};
\end{codeblock}
Furthermore, if
\tcode{A::\~{}A()}
were virtual,
the program would be ill-formed since a function that overrides a virtual
function from a base class
shall not have a potentially-throwing exception specification
if the base class function has a non-throwing exception specification.
\end{example}

\pnum
An exception specification is considered to be \defnx{needed}{needed!exception specification} when:
\begin{itemize}
\item in an expression, the function is selected by
overload resolution\iref{over.match,over.over};

\item the function is odr-used\iref{term.odr.use};

\item the exception specification is compared to that of another
declaration (e.g., an explicit specialization or an overriding virtual
function);

\item the function is defined; or

\item the exception specification is needed for a defaulted
function that calls the function.
\begin{note}
A defaulted declaration does not require the
exception specification of a base member function to be evaluated
until the implicit exception specification of the derived
function is needed, but an explicit \grammarterm{noexcept-specifier} needs
the implicit exception specification to compare against.
\end{note}
\end{itemize}
The exception specification of a defaulted
function is evaluated as described above only when needed; similarly, the
\grammarterm{noexcept-specifier} of a specialization
of a templated function
is instantiated only when needed.
