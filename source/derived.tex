During the lookup for a base class name, non-type names are
ignored~(\ref{basic.scope.hiding}). If the name found is not a
\grammarterm{class-name}, the program is ill-formed. A class \tcode{B} is a
base class of a class \tcode{D} if it is a direct base class of
\tcode{D} or a direct base class of one of \tcode{D}'s base classes.
\indextext{base~class!indirect}%
A class is an \term{indirect} base class of another if it is a base
class but not a direct base class. A class is said to be (directly or
indirectly) \term{derived} from its (direct or indirect) base
classes.

\grammarterm{access-specifier}.

\indextext{access control!base~class member}%
Unless redeclared in the derived class, members of a base class are also

Members of a base class other than constructors are said to be
\indextext{inheritance}%
\term{inherited}
by the derived class. Constructors of a base class
can also be inherited as described in~\ref{namespace.udecl}.
Inherited members can be referred to in
expressions in the same manner as other members of the derived class,
unless their names are hidden or ambiguous~(\ref{class.member.lookup}).
\indextext{operator!scope~resolution}%
\begin{note}
The scope resolution operator \tcode{::}~(\ref{expr.prim}) can be used
to refer to a direct or indirect base member explicitly. This allows
access to a name that has been redeclared in the derived class. A
derived class can itself serve as a base class subject to access
control; see~\ref{class.access.base}. A pointer to a derived class can be
implicitly converted to a pointer to an accessible unambiguous base
class~(\ref{conv.ptr}). An lvalue of a derived class type can be bound
to a reference to an accessible unambiguous base
class~(\ref{dcl.init.ref}).

with such a class. The non-static data members and member functions of
the direct base class cannot be referred to in the scope of the derived
class. However, the static members, enumerations and types can be
unambiguously referred to.

\pnum
\indextext{virtual~base~class}%
A base class specifier that does not contain the keyword
\tcode{virtual}, specifies a \grammarterm{non-virtual} base class. A base
class specifier that contains the keyword \tcode{virtual}, specifies a
\term{virtual} base class. For each distinct occurrence of a
non-virtual base class in the class lattice of the most derived class,
the most derived object~(\ref{intro.object}) shall contain a
corresponding distinct base class subobject of that type. For each
distinct base class that is specified virtual, the most derived object
shall contain a single base class subobject of that type.
\begin{example}
for an object of class type \tcode{C}, each distinct occurrence of a
(non-virtual) base class \tcode{L} in the class lattice of \tcode{C}
corresponds one-to-one with a distinct \tcode{L} subobject within the
object of type \tcode{C}. Given the class \tcode{C} defined above, an
object of class \tcode{C} will have two subobjects of class \tcode{L} as
shown below.

\pnum
In such lattices, explicit qualification can be used to specify which
subobject is meant. The body of function \tcode{C::f} could refer to the
member \tcode{next} of each \tcode{L} subobject:
\begin{codeblock}
void C::f() { A::next = B::next; }      // well-formed
\end{codeblock}
Without the \tcode{A::} or \tcode{B::} qualifiers, the definition of
\tcode{C::f} above would be ill-formed because of
ambiguity~(\ref{class.member.lookup}).

\pnum
For another example,
\begin{codeblock}
class V { /* ... */ };
class A : virtual public V { /* ... */ };
class B : virtual public V { /* ... */ };
class C : public A, public B { /* ... */ };
\end{codeblock}
for an object \tcode{c} of class type \tcode{C}, a single subobject of
type \tcode{V} is shared by every base subobject of \tcode{c} that has a
\tcode{virtual} base class of type \tcode{V}. Given the class \tcode{C}
defined above, an object of class \tcode{C} will have one subobject of
class \tcode{V}, as shown below.

base class \tcode{B} in the class lattice of \tcode{AA} correspond to a
single \tcode{B} subobject within the object of type \tcode{AA}, and
every other occurrence of a (non-virtual) base class \tcode{B} in the
class lattice of \tcode{AA} corresponds one-to-one with a distinct

\indextext{ambiguity!member access}

\pnum
Member name lookup determines the meaning of a name
(\grammarterm{id-expression}) in a class scope~(\ref{basic.scope.class}).
Name lookup can result in an \term{ambiguity}, in which case the
program is ill-formed. For an \grammarterm{id-expression}, name lookup
begins in the class scope of \tcode{this}; for a
\grammarterm{qualified-id}, name lookup begins in the scope of the
\grammarterm{nested-name-specifier}. Name lookup takes place before access
control~(\ref{basic.lookup}, Clause~\ref{class.access}).

\pnum
The following steps define the result of name lookup for a member name
\tcode{f} in a class scope \tcode{C}.

\pnum
The \term{lookup set} for \tcode{f} in \tcode{C}, called $S(f,C)$,
consists of two component sets: the \term{declaration set}, a set of
members named \tcode{f}; and the \term{subobject set}, a set of
subobjects where declarations of these members (possibly including
\grammarterm{using-declaration}{s}) were found. In the declaration set,
\grammarterm{using-declaration}{s} are replaced by the
set of designated members that are not hidden or overridden by members of the
derived class~(\ref{namespace.udecl}),
and type declarations (including injected-class-names) are
replaced by the types they designate. $S(f,C)$ is calculated as follows:

\pnum
If \tcode{C} contains a declaration of the name \tcode{f}, the
declaration set contains every declaration of \tcode{f} declared in
\tcode{C} that satisfies the requirements of the language construct in
which the lookup occurs.
\begin{note}
Looking up a name in an
\grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier}~(\ref{basic.lookup.elab}) or
\grammarterm{base-specifier} (Clause~\ref{class.derived}), for instance,
ignores all non-type declarations, while looking up a name in a
\grammarterm{nested-name-specifier}~(\ref{basic.lookup.qual}) ignores
function, variable, and enumerator declarations. As another example,
looking up a name in a
\grammarterm{using-declaration}~(\ref{namespace.udecl}) includes the
declaration of a class or enumeration that would ordinarily be hidden by
another declaration of that name in the same scope.
\end{note}
If the resulting declaration set is not empty, the subobject set
contains \tcode{C} itself, and calculation is complete.

\pnum
Otherwise (i.e., \tcode{C} does not contain a declaration of \tcode{f}
or the resulting declaration set is empty), $S(f,C)$ is initially empty.
If \tcode{C} has base classes, calculate the lookup set for \tcode{f} in
each direct base class subobject $B_i$, and merge each such lookup set
$S(f,B_i)$ in turn into $S(f,C)$.

\pnum
The following steps define the result of merging lookup set $S(f,B_i)$
into the intermediate $S(f,C)$:

\begin{itemize}
\item If each of the subobject members of $S(f,B_i)$ is a base class
subobject of at least one of the subobject members of $S(f,C)$, or if
$S(f,B_i)$ is empty, $S(f,C)$ is unchanged and the merge is complete.
Conversely, if each of the subobject members of $S(f,C)$ is a base class
subobject of at least one of the subobject members of $S(f,B_i)$, or if
$S(f,C)$ is empty, the new $S(f,C)$ is a copy of $S(f,B_i)$.

\item Otherwise, if the declaration sets of $S(f,B_i)$ and $S(f,C)$
differ, the merge is ambiguous: the new $S(f,C)$ is a lookup set with an
invalid declaration set and the union of the subobject sets. In
subsequent merges, an invalid declaration set is considered different
from any other.

\item Otherwise, the new $S(f,C)$ is a lookup set with the shared set of
declarations and the union of the subobject sets.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The result of name lookup for \tcode{f} in \tcode{C} is the declaration
set of $S(f,C)$. If it is an invalid set, the program is ill-formed.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A { int x; };                    // S(x,A) = \{ \{ \tcode{A::x} \}, \{ \tcode{A} \} \}
struct B { float x; };                  // S(x,B) = \{ \{ \tcode{B::x} \}, \{ \tcode{B} \} \}
struct C: public A, public B { };       // S(x,C) = \{ invalid, \{ \tcode{A} in \tcode{C}, \tcode{B} in \tcode{C} \} \}
struct D: public virtual C { };         // S(x,D) = S(x,C)
struct E: public virtual C { char x; }; // S(x,E) = \{ \{ \tcode{E::x} \}, \{ \tcode{E} \} \}
struct F: public D, public E { };       // S(x,F) = S(x,E)
int main() {
  F f;
  f.x = 0;                              // OK, lookup finds \tcode{E::x}
}
\end{codeblock}

$S(x,F)$ is unambiguous because the \tcode{A} and \tcode{B} base
subobjects of \tcode{D} are also base subobjects of \tcode{E}, so
$S(x,D)$ is discarded in the first merge step.
\end{example}

\pnum
If a virtual function is marked with the \grammarterm{virt-specifier} \tcode{override} and
does not override a member function of a base class, the program is ill-formed. \begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct B {
  virtual void f(int);
};

struct D : B {
  virtual void f(long) override;  // error: wrong signature overriding \tcode{B::f}
  virtual void f(int) override;   // OK
};
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
Even though destructors are not inherited, a destructor in a derived
class overrides a base class destructor declared virtual;
see~\ref{class.dtor} and~\ref{class.free}.

\pnum
The return type of an overriding function shall be either identical to
the return type of the overridden function or \term{covariant} with
the classes of the functions. If a function \tcode{D::f} overrides a
function \tcode{B::f}, the return types of the functions are covariant
if they satisfy the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item both are pointers to classes, both are lvalue references to
classes, or both are rvalue references to classes\footnote{Multi-level pointers to classes or references to multi-level pointers to
classes are not allowed.% 
}

\item the class in the return type of \tcode{B::f} is the same class as
the class in the return type of \tcode{D::f}, or is an unambiguous and
accessible direct or indirect base class of the class in the return type
of \tcode{D::f}

\item both pointers or references have the same cv-qualification and the
class type in the return type of \tcode{D::f} has the same
cv-qualification as or less cv-qualification than the class type in the
return type of \tcode{B::f}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
If the class type in the covariant return type of \tcode{D::f} differs from that of
\tcode{B::f}, the class type in the return type of \tcode{D::f} shall be
complete at the point of declaration of \tcode{D::f} or shall be the
class type \tcode{D}. When the overriding function is called as the
final overrider of the overridden function, its result is converted to
the type returned by the (statically chosen) overridden
function~(\ref{expr.call}).

    void vf2(int);  // not virtual, hides \tcode{Base::vf2()}
    char vf3();     // error: invalid difference in return type only
    D*  vf4();      // OK: returns pointer to derived class
    A*  vf5();      // error: returns pointer to incomplete class
    void f();
};

  Derived d;
  Base* bp = &d;                // standard conversion:

  bp->vf1();                    // calls \tcode{Derived::vf1()}
  bp->vf2();                    // calls \tcode{Base::vf2()}
  bp->f();                      // calls \tcode{Base::f()} (not virtual)
  B*  p = bp->vf4();            // calls \tcode{Derived::pf()} and converts the
                                // result to \tcode{B*}
  Derived*  dp = &d;
  D*  q = dp->vf4();            // calls \tcode{Derived::pf()} and does not
                                // convert the result to \tcode{B*}
  dp->vf2();                    // ill-formed: argument mismatch
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
The interpretation of the call of a virtual function depends on the type
of the object for which it is called (the dynamic type), whereas the
interpretation of a call of a non-virtual member function depends only
on the type of the pointer or reference denoting that object (the static
type)~(\ref{expr.call}).
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
The \tcode{virtual} specifier implies membership, so a virtual function
cannot be a nonmember~(\ref{dcl.fct.spec}) function. Nor can a virtual
function be a static member, since a virtual function call relies on a
specific object for determining which function to invoke. A virtual
function declared in one class can be declared a \tcode{friend} in
another class.

A virtual function declared in a class shall be defined, or declared
pure~(\ref{class.abstract}) in that class, or both; but no diagnostic is

\pnum
\indextext{multiple~inheritance!\tcode{virtual}~and}%
\begin{example}
here are some uses of virtual functions with multiple base classes:
\indextext{example!virtual~function}%
\begin{codeblock}
struct A {
  virtual void f();
};

struct B1 : A {                 // note non-virtual derivation
  void f();
};

struct B2 : A {
  void f();
};

struct D : B1, B2 {             // \tcode{D} has two separate \tcode{A} subobjects
};

void foo() {
  D   d;
//\tcode{   A*  ap = \&d;}                  // would be ill-formed: ambiguous
  B1*  b1p = &d;
  A*   ap = b1p;
  D*   dp = &d;
  ap->f();                      // calls \tcode{D::B1::f}
  dp->f();                      // ill-formed: ambiguous
}
\end{codeblock}
In class \tcode{D} above there are two occurrences of class \tcode{A}
and hence two occurrences of the virtual member function \tcode{A::f}.
The final overrider of \tcode{B1::A::f} is \tcode{B1::f} and the final
overrider of \tcode{B2::A::f} is \tcode{B2::f}.

\pnum
The following example shows a function that does not have a unique final
overrider:
\begin{codeblock}
struct A {
  virtual void f();
};

struct VB1 : virtual A {        // note virtual derivation
  void f();
};

struct VB2 : virtual A {
  void f();
};

struct Error : VB1, VB2 {       // ill-formed
};

struct Okay : VB1, VB2 {
  void f();
};
\end{codeblock}
Both \tcode{VB1::f} and \tcode{VB2::f} override \tcode{A::f} but there
is no overrider of both of them in class \tcode{Error}. This example is
therefore ill-formed. Class \tcode{Okay} is well formed, however,
because \tcode{Okay::f} is a final overrider.

\pnum
The following example uses the well-formed classes from above.
\begin{codeblock}
struct VB1a : virtual A {       // does not declare \tcode{f}
};

struct Da : VB1a, VB2 {
};

void foe() {
  VB1a*  vb1ap = new Da;
  vb1ap->f();                   // calls \tcode{VB2::f}
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

Explicit qualification with the scope operator~(\ref{expr.prim})

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
class B { public: virtual void f(); };
class D : public B { public: void f(); };

void D::f() { /* ... */ B::f(); }
\end{codeblock}

Here, the function call in
\tcode{D::f}
really does call
\tcode{B::f}
and not
\tcode{D::f}.
\end{example}

\pnum
A function with a deleted definition~(\ref{dcl.fct.def}) shall
not override a function that does not have a deleted definition. Likewise,
a function that does not have a deleted definition shall not override a
function with a deleted definition.%

\indextext{class!abstract}

\pnum
The abstract class mechanism supports the notion of a general concept,
such as a \tcode{shape}, of which only more concrete variants, such as
\tcode{circle} and \tcode{square}, can actually be used. An abstract
class can also be used to define an interface for which derived classes
provide a variety of implementations.

\pnum
An \term{abstract class} is a class that can be used only
as a base class of some other class; no objects of an abstract class can
be created except as subobjects of a class derived from it. A class is
abstract if it has at least one \term{pure virtual function}.
\begin{note}
Such a function might be inherited: see below.
\end{note}
\indextext{virtual~function!pure}%
A virtual function is specified \term{pure} by using a
\grammarterm{pure-specifier}~(\ref{class.mem}) in the function declaration
in the class definition.
\indextext{definition!pure virtual~function}%
A pure virtual function need be defined only if called with, or as if
with~(\ref{class.dtor}), the \grammarterm{qualified-id}
syntax~(\ref{expr.prim}).
\begin{example}
\indextext{example!pure virtual~function}%
\begin{codeblock}
class point { /* ... */ };
class shape {                   // abstract class
  point center;
public:
  point where() { return center; }
  void move(point p) { center=p; draw(); }
  virtual void rotate(int) = 0; // pure virtual
  virtual void draw() = 0;      // pure virtual
};
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
A function declaration cannot provide both a \grammarterm{pure-specifier}
and a definition
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct C {
  virtual void f() = 0 { };     // ill-formed
};
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\indextext{class!pointer~to abstract}%
An abstract class shall not be used as a parameter type, as a function
return type, or as the type of an explicit conversion. Pointers and
references to an abstract class can be declared.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
shape x;                        // error: object of abstract class
shape* p;                       // OK
shape f();                      // error
void g(shape);                  // error
shape& h(shape&);               // OK
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\indextext{virtual~function!pure}%
A class is abstract if it contains or inherits at least one pure virtual
function for which the final overrider is pure virtual.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
class ab_circle : public shape {
  int radius;
public:
  void rotate(int) { }
  // \tcode{ab_circle::draw()} is a pure virtual
};
\end{codeblock}

Since \tcode{shape::draw()} is a pure virtual function
\tcode{ab_circle::draw()} is a pure virtual by default. The alternative
declaration,
\begin{codeblock}
class circle : public shape {
  int radius;
public:
  void rotate(int) { }
  void draw();                  // a definition is required somewhere
};
\end{codeblock}
would make class \tcode{circle} nonabstract and a definition of
\tcode{circle::draw()} must be provided.
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
An abstract class can be derived from a class that is not abstract, and
a pure virtual function may override a virtual function which is not
pure.
\end{note}
