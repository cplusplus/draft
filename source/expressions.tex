\indextext{expression|(}%
\begin{note}
Clause~\ref{expr} defines the syntax, order of evaluation, and meaning
of expressions.\footnote{The precedence of operators is not directly specified, but it can be
derived from the syntax.}
An expression is a sequence of operators and operands that specifies a
computation. An expression can result in a value and can cause side
effects.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{operator!overloaded}%
\begin{note}
Operators can be overloaded, that is, given meaning when applied to
expressions of class type~(Clause \ref{class}) or enumeration
type~(\ref{dcl.enum}). Uses of overloaded operators are transformed into
function calls as described in~\ref{over.oper}. Overloaded operators
obey the rules for syntax and evaluation order specified in Clause~\ref{expr},
but the requirements of operand type and value category are replaced
by the rules for function call. Relations between operators, such as
\tcode{++a} meaning \tcode{a+=1}, are not guaranteed for overloaded
operators~(\ref{over.oper}).
\end{note}

\pnum
Clause~\ref{expr} defines the effects of operators when applied to types
for which they have not been overloaded. Operator overloading shall not
modify the rules for the \defnx{built-in operators}{operators!built-in},
that is, for operators applied to types for which they are defined by this
Standard. However, these built-in operators participate in overload
resolution, and as part of that process user-defined conversions will be
considered where necessary to convert the operands to types appropriate
for the built-in operator. If a built-in operator is selected, such
conversions will be applied to the operands before the operation is
considered further according to the rules in Clause~\ref{expr};
see~\ref{over.match.oper},~\ref{over.built}.

\pnum
\indextext{exception!arithmetic}%
\indextext{exception!undefined arithmetic}%
\indextext{overflow!undefined}%
\indextext{zero!division by undefined}%
\indextext{zero!remainder undefined}%
If during the evaluation of an expression, the result is not
mathematically defined or not in the range of representable values for
its type, the behavior is undefined.
\begin{note}
\indextext{overflow}%
Treatment of division by zero, forming a remainder using a zero divisor,
and all floating point exceptions vary among machines, and is sometimes
adjustable by a library function.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{expression!reference}%
If an expression initially has the type ``reference to
\tcode{T}''~(\ref{dcl.ref},~\ref{dcl.init.ref}), the type is adjusted to
\tcode{T} prior to any further analysis. The expression designates the
object or function denoted by the reference, and the expression
is an lvalue or an xvalue, depending on the expression.
\begin{note}
Before the lifetime of the reference has started or after it has ended,
the behavior is undefined (see~\ref{basic.life}).
\end{note}

\pnum
If a prvalue initially has the type ``\cv{} \tcode{T}'', where
\tcode{T} is a cv-unqualified non-class, non-array type, the type of
the expression is adjusted to \tcode{T} prior to any further analysis.

\pnum
\indextext{expression!rvalue~reference}%
\begin{note}
An expression is an xvalue if it is:
\begin{itemize}
\item the result of calling a function, whether implicitly or explicitly,
whose return type is an rvalue reference to object type,

\item a cast to an rvalue reference to object type,

\item a class member access expression designating a non-static data member
of non-reference type
in which the object expression is an xvalue, or

\item a \tcode{.*} pointer-to-member expression in which the first operand is
an xvalue and the second operand is a pointer to data member.
\end{itemize}
In general, the effect of this rule is that named rvalue references are
treated as lvalues and unnamed rvalue references to objects are treated as
xvalues; rvalue references to functions are treated as lvalues whether named or not.
\end{note}

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A {
  int m;
};
A&& operator+(A, A);
A&& f();

A a;
A&& ar = static_cast<A&&>(a);
\end{codeblock}

The expressions \tcode{f()}, \tcode{f().m}, \tcode{static_cast<A\&\&>(a)}, and \tcode{a + a}
are xvalues. The expression \tcode{ar} is an lvalue.
\end{example}

\pnum
In some contexts, \defnx{unevaluated operands}{unevaluated operand}
appear~(\ref{expr.typeid}, \ref{expr.sizeof}, \ref{expr.unary.noexcept}, \ref{dcl.type.simple}).
An unevaluated operand is not evaluated.
\begin{note}
In an unevaluated operand, a non-static class member may be
named~(\ref{expr.prim}) and naming of objects or functions does not, by
itself, require that a definition be provided~(\ref{basic.def.odr}).
An unevaluated operand is considered a full-expression~(\ref{intro.execution}).
\end{note}

\pnum
Whenever a glvalue expression appears as an operand of an operator that
expects a prvalue for that operand, the
lvalue-to-rvalue~(\ref{conv.lval}), array-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.array}),
or function-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.func}) standard conversions are
applied to convert the expression to a prvalue.
\begin{note}
because cv-qualifiers are removed from the type of an expression of
non-class type when the expression is converted to a prvalue, an lvalue
expression of type \tcode{const int} can, for example, be used where
a prvalue expression of type \tcode{int} is required.
\end{note}

\pnum
Whenever a prvalue expression appears as an operand of an operator that
expects a glvalue for that operand, the
temporary materialization conversion~(\ref{conv.rval}) is
applied to convert the expression to an xvalue.

\pnum
\indextext{conversion!usual arithmetic}%
Many binary operators that expect operands of arithmetic or enumeration
type cause conversions and yield result types in a similar way. The
purpose is to yield a common type, which is also the type of the result.
This pattern is called the \term{usual arithmetic conversions},
which are defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If either operand is of scoped enumeration type~(\ref{dcl.enum}), no conversions
are performed; if the other operand does not have the same type, the expression is
ill-formed.

\item If either operand is of type \tcode{long} \tcode{double}, the
other shall be converted to \tcode{long} \tcode{double}.

\item Otherwise, if either operand is \tcode{double}, the other shall be
converted to \tcode{double}.

\item Otherwise, if either operand is \tcode{float}, the other shall be
converted to \tcode{float}.

\item Otherwise, the integral promotions~(\ref{conv.prom}) shall be
performed on both operands.\footnote{As a consequence, operands of type \tcode{bool}, \tcode{char16_t},
\tcode{char32_t}, \tcode{wchar_t}, or an enumerated type are converted
to some integral type.}
Then the following rules shall be applied to the promoted operands:

\begin{itemize}

\item If both operands have the same type, no further conversion is
needed.

\item Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have
unsigned integer types, the operand with the type of lesser integer
conversion rank shall be converted to the type of the operand with
greater rank.

\item Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank
greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, the
operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the
operand with unsigned integer type.

\item Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can
represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned
integer type, the operand with unsigned integer type shall be converted
to the type of the operand with signed integer type.

\item Otherwise, both operands shall be converted to the unsigned
integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed
integer type.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\pnum
In some contexts, an expression only appears for its side effects. Such an
expression is called a \defn{discarded-value expression}.
The array-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.array})
and function-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.func}) standard conversions are not
applied. The lvalue-to-rvalue conversion~(\ref{conv.lval}) is applied
if and only if
the expression is a glvalue of volatile-qualified type and it is one of the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{(} \grammarterm{expression} \tcode{)}, where
  \grammarterm{expression} is one of these expressions,
\item \grammarterm{id-expression}~(\ref{expr.prim.id}),
\item subscripting~(\ref{expr.sub}),
\item class member access~(\ref{expr.ref}),
\item indirection~(\ref{expr.unary.op}),
\item pointer-to-member operation~(\ref{expr.mptr.oper}),
\item conditional expression~(\ref{expr.cond}) where both the second and the
      third operands are one of these expressions, or
\item comma expression~(\ref{expr.comma}) where the right operand is one of
      these expressions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{note} Using an overloaded operator causes a function call; the
above covers only operators with built-in meaning.
\end{note}
If the expression is a prvalue after this optional conversion,
the temporary materialization conversion~(\ref{conv.rval}) is applied.
\begin{note}
If the expression is an lvalue of
class type, it must have a volatile copy constructor to initialize the
temporary that is the result object of the lvalue-to-rvalue
conversion. \end{note}
The glvalue expression is evaluated and its value is discarded.

\pnum
The values of the floating operands and the results of floating
expressions may be represented in greater precision and range than that
required by the type; the types are not changed\
thereby.\footnote{The cast and assignment operators must still perform their specific
conversions as described in~\ref{expr.cast},~\ref{expr.static.cast}
and~\ref{expr.ass}.}

\pnum
The \defnx{cv-combined type}{type!cv-combined} of two types \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2}
is a type \tcode{T3}
similar to \tcode{T1} whose cv-qualification signature~(\ref{conv.qual}) is:
\begin{itemize}
\item
for every $j > 0$, \cv$_{3,j}$ is the union of
\cv$_{1,j}$ and \cv$_{2,j}$;

\item
if the resulting \cv$_{3,j}$ is different from
\cv$_{1,j}$ or \cv$_{2,j}$, then
\tcode{const} is added to every \cv$_{3,k}$ for $0 < k < j$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{note} Given similar types \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2}, this
construction ensures that
both can be converted to \tcode{T3}. \end{note}
\indextext{pointer!composite pointer type}%
The \defn{composite pointer type} of
two operands \tcode{p1} and
\tcode{p2} having types \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2}, respectively, where at least one is a
pointer or pointer to member type or
\tcode{std::nullptr_t}, is:

\begin{itemize}
\item
if both \tcode{p1} and \tcode{p2} are null pointer constants,
\tcode{std::nullptr_t};

\item
if either \tcode{p1} or \tcode{p2} is a null pointer constant, \tcode{T2} or \tcode{T1},
respectively;

\item

other type is ``pointer to \cvqual{cv2} T'', ``pointer to \cvqual{cv12}
\tcode{void}'', where \cvqual{cv12} is the union of \cvqual{cv1}
and \cvqual{cv2};

\item
if \tcode{T1} or \tcode{T2} is ``pointer to \tcode{noexcept} function'' and the
other type is ``pointer to function'', where the function types are otherwise the same,
``pointer to function'';

\item
if \tcode{T1} is ``pointer to \cvqual{cv1} \tcode{C1}'' and \tcode{T2} is ``pointer to
\cvqual{cv2} \tcode{C2}'', where \tcode{C1} is reference-related to \tcode{C2} or \tcode{C2} is
reference-related to \tcode{C1}~(\ref{dcl.init.ref}), the cv-combined type
of \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2} or the cv-combined type of \tcode{T2} and \tcode{T1},
respectively;

\item
if \tcode{T1} is ``pointer to member of \tcode{C1} of type \cvqual{cv1} \tcode{U1}'' and \tcode{T2} is
``pointer to member of \tcode{C2} of type \cvqual{cv2} \tcode{U2}'' where \tcode{C1} is
reference-related to \tcode{C2} or \tcode{C2} is reference-related to
\tcode{C1}~(\ref{dcl.init.ref}), the cv-combined type of \tcode{T2} and \tcode{T1} or the cv-combined type
of \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2}, respectively;

\item
if \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2} are similar types~(\ref{conv.qual}), the cv-combined type of \tcode{T1} and
\tcode{T2};

\item
otherwise, a program that necessitates the determination of a
composite pointer type is ill-formed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
typedef void *p;
typedef const int *q;
typedef int **pi;
typedef const int **pci;
\end{codeblock}

The composite pointer type of \tcode{p} and \tcode{q} is ``pointer to \tcode{const void}''; the
composite pointer type of \tcode{pi} and \tcode{pci} is ``pointer to \tcode{const} pointer to
\tcode{const int}''.

\pnum
A \grammarterm{lambda-expression} is a prvalue
whose result object is called the \defn{closure object}. A
\grammarterm{lambda-expression} shall not appear in an unevaluated operand
(Clause~\ref{expr}), in a \grammarterm{template-argument},
in an \grammarterm{alias-declaration},
in a typedef declaration, or in the declaration of a function or function
template outside its function body and default arguments.
\begin{note}
The intention is to prevent lambdas from appearing in a signature.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
A closure object behaves like a function
object~(\ref{function.objects}).\end{note}

\pnum
The type of the \grammarterm{lambda-expression} (which is also the type of the
closure object) is a unique, unnamed non-union class type
--- called the \defn{closure type} ---
whose properties are described below.
This class type is not an aggregate type~(\ref{dcl.init.aggr}).
The closure type is declared in the smallest block
scope, class scope, or namespace scope that contains the corresponding
\grammarterm{lambda-expression}. \begin{note} This determines the set of namespaces and
classes associated with the closure type~(\ref{basic.lookup.argdep}). The parameter
types of a \grammarterm{lambda-declarator} do not affect these associated namespaces and
classes. \end{note} An implementation may define the closure type differently from what
is described below provided this does not alter the observable behavior of the program
other than by changing:

\begin{itemize}
\item the size and/or alignment of the closure type,

\item whether the closure type is trivially copyable (Clause~\ref{class}),

\item whether the closure type is a standard-layout class (Clause~\ref{class}),
or

\item whether the closure type is a POD class (Clause~\ref{class}).
\end{itemize}

An implementation shall not add members of rvalue reference type to the closure
type.

\pnum
If a \grammarterm{lambda-expression} does not include a
\grammarterm{lambda-declarator}, it is as if the \grammarterm{lambda-declarator} were
\tcode{()}.
The lambda return type is \tcode{auto}, which is replaced by the
type specified by the
\grammarterm{trailing-return-type} if provided and/or deduced from
\tcode{return} statements as described in~\ref{dcl.spec.auto}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
auto x1 = [](int i){ return i; };     // OK: return type is \tcode{int}
auto x2 = []{ return { 1, 2 }; };     // error: deducing return type from \grammarterm{braced-init-list}
int j;
auto x3 = []()->auto&& { return j; }; // OK: return type is \tcode{int\&}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
The closure type for a non-generic \grammarterm{lambda-expression} has a public
inline function call operator~(\ref{over.call}) whose parameters and return type
are described by the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}'s
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} and \grammarterm{trailing-return-type}
respectively.
For a generic lambda, the closure type has a public inline function call
operator member template~(\ref{temp.mem}) whose
\grammarterm{template-parameter-list} consists of one invented type
\grammarterm{template-parameter} for each occurrence of \tcode{auto} in the
lambda's \grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause}, in order of appearance.
The invented type \grammarterm{template-parameter} is a parameter pack if
the corresponding \grammarterm{parameter-declaration} declares a function
parameter pack~(\ref{dcl.fct}). The return type and function parameters of the
function call operator template are derived from the
\grammarterm{lambda-expression}{'s} \grammarterm{trailing-return-type} and
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} by replacing each occurrence of
\tcode{auto} in the \grammarterm{decl-specifier}{s} of the
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} with the name of the corresponding
invented \grammarterm{template-parameter}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
  auto glambda = [](auto a, auto&& b) { return a < b; };
  bool b = glambda(3, 3.14);                                  // OK
  auto vglambda = [](auto printer) {
     return [=](auto&& ... ts) {                              // OK: \tcode{ts} is a function parameter pack
         printer(std::forward<decltype(ts)>(ts)...);

         return [=]() {
           printer(ts ...);
         };
     };
  };
  auto p = vglambda( [](auto v1, auto v2, auto v3)
                         { std::cout << v1 << v2 << v3; } );
  auto q = p(1, 'a', 3.14);                                   // OK: outputs \tcode{1a3.14}
  q();                                                        // OK: outputs \tcode{1a3.14}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
This function call operator or operator template is declared
\tcode{const}~(\ref{class.mfct.non-static}) if and only if the
\grammarterm{lambda-expression}'s \grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} is not
followed by \tcode{mutable}. It is neither virtual nor declared \tcode{volatile}. Any
\grammarterm{noexcept-specifier} specified on a \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
applies to the corresponding function call operator or operator template.
An \grammarterm{attribute-specifier-seq} in a \grammarterm{lambda-declarator} appertains
to the type of the corresponding function call operator or operator template.
The function call operator or any given operator template specialization
is a constexpr function if either
the corresponding \grammarterm{lambda-expression}{'s}
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} is followed by \tcode{constexpr}, or
it satisfies the requirements for a constexpr function~(\ref{dcl.constexpr}).
\begin{note} Names referenced in
the \grammarterm{lambda-declarator} are looked up in the context in which the
\grammarterm{lambda-expression} appears. \end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
auto ID = [](auto a) { return a; };
static_assert(ID(3) == 3); // OK

struct NonLiteral {
  NonLiteral(int n) : n(n) { }
  int n;
};
static_assert(ID(NonLiteral{3}).n == 3); // ill-formed
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
The closure type for a non-generic \grammarterm{lambda-expression} with no
\grammarterm{lambda-capture}
has a conversion function to pointer to
function with \Cpp language linkage~(\ref{dcl.link}) having
the same parameter and return types as the closure type's function call operator.
The conversion is to ``pointer to \tcode{noexcept} function''
if the function call operator
has a non-throwing exception specification.
The value returned by this conversion function
is the address of a function \tcode{F} that, when invoked,
has the same effect as invoking the closure type's function call operator.
\tcode{F} is a constexpr function
if the function call operator is a constexpr function.
For a generic lambda with no \grammarterm{lambda-capture}, the closure type has a
conversion function template to
pointer to function. The conversion function template has the same invented
\grammarterm{template-parameter-list}, and the pointer to function has the same
parameter types, as the function call operator template.  The return type of
the pointer to function shall behave as if it were a
\grammarterm{decltype-specifier} denoting the return type of the corresponding
function call operator template specialization.
\begin{note}
If the generic lambda has no \grammarterm{trailing-return-type} or
the \grammarterm{trailing-return-type} contains a placeholder type, return type
deduction of the corresponding function call operator template specialization
has to be done. The corresponding specialization is that instantiation of the
function call operator template with the same template arguments as those
deduced for the conversion function template.  Consider the following:
\begin{codeblock}
auto glambda = [](auto a) { return a; };
int (*fp)(int) = glambda;
\end{codeblock}
The behavior of the conversion function of \tcode{glambda} above is like
that of the following conversion function:
\begin{codeblock}
struct Closure {
  template<class T> auto operator()(T t) const { ... }
  template<class T> static auto lambda_call_operator_invoker(T a) {
    // forwards execution to \tcode{operator()(a)} and therefore has
    // the same return type deduced
    ...
  }
  template<class T> using fptr_t =
     decltype(lambda_call_operator_invoker(declval<T>())) (*)(T);

  template<class T> operator fptr_t<T>() const
    { return &lambda_call_operator_invoker; }
};
\end{codeblock}
\end{note}

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void f1(int (*)(int))   { }
void f2(char (*)(int))  { }

void g(int (*)(int))    { }  // \#1
void g(char (*)(char))  { }  // \#2

void h(int (*)(int))    { }  // \#3
void h(char (*)(int))   { }  // \#4

auto glambda = [](auto a) { return a; };
f1(glambda);  // OK
f2(glambda);  // error: ID is not convertible
g(glambda);   // error: ambiguous
h(glambda);   // OK: calls \#3 since it is convertible from ID
int& (*fpi)(int*) = [](auto* a) -> auto& { return *a; }; // OK
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

The value returned by any given specialization of this conversion function
template is the address of a function \tcode{F} that, when invoked, has the same
effect as invoking the generic lambda's corresponding function call operator
template specialization.
\tcode{F} is a constexpr function
if the corresponding specialization is a constexpr function.
\begin{note}
This will result in the implicit instantiation of the generic lambda's body.
The instantiated generic lambda's return type and parameter types shall match
the return type and parameter types of the pointer to function.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
auto GL = [](auto a) { std::cout << a; return a; };
int (*GL_int)(int) = GL;  // OK: through conversion function template
GL_int(3);                // OK: same as \tcode{GL(3)}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

The conversion function or conversion function template is public,
constexpr, non-virtual, non-explicit, const, and has a non-throwing exception
specification~(\ref{except.spec}).
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
auto Fwd = [](int (*fp)(int), auto a) { return fp(a); };
auto C = [](auto a) { return a; };

static_assert(Fwd(C,3) == 3); // OK

// No specialization of the function call operator template can be constexpr (due to the local static).
auto NC = [](auto a) { static int s; return a; };
static_assert(Fwd(NC,3) == 3); // ill-formed
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
The \grammarterm{lambda-expression}'s \grammarterm{compound-statement} yields the
\grammarterm{function-body}~(\ref{dcl.fct.def}) of the function call operator, but for
purposes of name lookup~(\ref{basic.lookup}), determining the type and value of
\tcode{this}~(\ref{class.this}) and transforming \grammarterm{id-expression}{s}
referring to non-static class members into class member access expressions using
\tcode{(*this)}~(\ref{class.mfct.non-static}), the \grammarterm{compound-statement} is
considered in the context of the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}. \begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
struct S1 {
  int x, y;
  int operator()(int);
  void f() {
    [=]()->int {
      return operator()(this->x + y); // equivalent to \tcode{S1::operator()(this->x + (*this).y)}
                                      // \tcode{this} has type \tcode{S1*}
    };
  }
};
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
Further, a variable \tcode{__func__} is implicitly defined at the beginning of
the \grammarterm{compound-statement} of the \grammarterm{lambda-expression},
with semantics as described in~\ref{dcl.fct.def.general}.

\pnum
If a \grammarterm{lambda-capture} includes a \grammarterm{capture-default} that
is \tcode{\&}, no identifier in a \grammarterm{simple-capture} of that
\grammarterm{lambda-capture} shall be preceded
by \tcode{\&}. If a \grammarterm{lambda-capture} includes a
\grammarterm{capture-default} that is \tcode{=}, each
\grammarterm{simple-capture} of that \grammarterm{lambda-capture} shall
be of the form ``\tcode{\&} \grammarterm{identifier}'' or ``\tcode{* this}''.
\begin{note} The form \tcode{[\&,this]} is redundant but accepted
for compatibility with ISO \CppXIV. \end{note}
Ignoring appearances in
\grammarterm{initializer}{s} of \grammarterm{init-capture}{s}, an identifier or
\tcode{this} shall not appear more than once in a
\grammarterm{lambda-capture}. \begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
struct S2 { void f(int i); };
void S2::f(int i) {
  [&, i]{ };        // OK
  [&, &i]{ };       // error: \tcode{i} preceded by \tcode{\&} when \tcode{\&} is the default
  [=, *this]{ };    // OK
  [=, this]{ };     // error: \tcode{this} when \tcode{=} is the default
  [i, i]{ };        // error: \tcode{i} repeated
  [this, *this]{ }; // error: \tcode{this} appears twice
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
A \grammarterm{lambda-expression} whose smallest enclosing scope is a block
scope~(\ref{basic.scope.block}) is a \defn{local lambda expression}; any other
\grammarterm{lambda-expression} shall not have a \grammarterm{capture-default} or
\grammarterm{simple-capture} in its
\grammarterm{lambda-introducer}. The \defn{reaching scope} of a local lambda expression
is the set of enclosing scopes up to and including the innermost enclosing function and
its parameters. \begin{note} This reaching scope includes any intervening
\grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s}. \end{note}

\pnum
The \grammarterm{identifier} in a \grammarterm{simple-capture} is looked up using the
usual rules for unqualified name lookup~(\ref{basic.lookup.unqual}); each such lookup
shall find an entity.  An entity that is designated by a
\grammarterm{simple-capture}
is said to be \defn{explicitly captured}, and shall be \tcode{*this}
(when the \grammarterm{simple-capture}
is ``\tcode{this}'' or ``\tcode{* this}'') or
a variable with automatic storage duration declared in
the reaching scope of the local lambda expression.

\pnum
An \grammarterm{init-capture} behaves as if it declares and explicitly captures a
variable of
the form ``\tcode{auto} \grammarterm{init-capture} \tcode{;}''
whose declarative region is the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}'s
\grammarterm{compound-statement}, except that:
\begin{itemize}
\item if the capture is by copy (see below), the non-static data member
declared for the capture and the variable are treated as two different ways
of referring to the same object, which has the lifetime of the non-static
data member, and no additional copy and destruction is performed, and
\item if the capture is by reference, the variable's lifetime ends when the
closure object's lifetime ends.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
This enables an \grammarterm{init-capture} like
``\tcode{x = std::move(x)}''; the second ``\tcode{x}'' must bind to a
declaration in the surrounding context.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
int x = 4;
auto y = [&r = x, x = x+1]()->int {
            r += 2;
            return x+2;
         }();  // Updates \tcode{::x} to 6, and initializes \tcode{y} to 7.
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
A \grammarterm{lambda-expression} with an associated
\grammarterm{capture-default} that does not explicitly capture \tcode{*this} or
a variable with automatic storage duration (this excludes any \grammarterm{id-expression}
that has been found to refer to an \grammarterm{init-capture}{'s} associated
\indextext{implicit capture!definition of}%
non-static data member), is said to \defnx{implicitly capture}{capture!implicit}
the entity (i.e.,
\tcode{*this} or a variable) if the \grammarterm{compound-statement}:
\begin{itemize}
\item odr-uses~(\ref{basic.def.odr}) the entity (in the case of a variable),
\item odr-uses~(\ref{basic.def.odr}) \tcode{this}
(in the case of the object designated by \tcode{*this}), or
\item names the entity in a potentially-evaluated
expression~(\ref{basic.def.odr}) where the enclosing full-expression depends on
a generic lambda parameter declared within the reaching scope of the
\grammarterm{lambda-expression}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void f(int, const int (&)[2] = {})    { }   // \#1
void f(const int&, const int (&)[1])  { }   // \#2
void test() {
  const int x = 17;
  auto g = [](auto a) {
    f(x);  // OK: calls \#1, does not capture \tcode{x}
  };

  auto g2 = [=](auto a) {
    int selector[sizeof(a) == 1 ? 1 : 2]{};
    f(x, selector);  // OK: is a dependent expression, so captures \tcode{x}
  };
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
All such implicitly captured
entities shall be declared within the reaching scope of the lambda expression.
\begin{note} The implicit capture of an entity by a nested
\grammarterm{lambda-expression} can cause its implicit capture by the containing
\grammarterm{lambda-expression} (see below). Implicit odr-uses of \tcode{this} can result
in implicit capture. \end{note}

\pnum
An entity is \defn{captured} if it is captured explicitly or implicitly. An entity
captured by a \grammarterm{lambda-expression} is odr-used~(\ref{basic.def.odr}) in the scope
containing the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}. If \tcode{*this} is captured by a local
lambda expression, its nearest enclosing function shall be a non-static member function.
If a \grammarterm{lambda-expression} or an instantiation of the function call
operator template of a generic lambda odr-uses~(\ref{basic.def.odr}) \tcode{this} or a
variable with automatic storage duration from its reaching scope, that
entity shall be captured by the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}. If a
\grammarterm{lambda-expression} captures an entity and that entity is not defined or
captured in the immediately enclosing lambda expression or function, the program is
ill-formed. \begin{example}

A \grammarterm{lambda-expression} appearing in a default argument shall not

\pnum
An entity is \defnx{captured by copy}{captured!by~copy} if
\begin{itemize}
\item
it is implicitly captured,
the \grammarterm{capture-default} is \tcode{=}, and
the captured entity is not \tcode{*this}, or
\item
it is explicitly captured with a capture that is not of the form
\tcode{this},
\tcode{\&} \grammarterm{identifier}, or
\tcode{\&} \grammarterm{identifier} \grammarterm{initializer}.
\end{itemize}
For each entity captured by copy, an
unnamed non-static data member is declared in the closure type. The declaration order of
these members is unspecified. The type of such a data member is
the referenced type if the entity is a reference to an object,
an lvalue reference to the referenced function type if the entity is a reference to a function, or
the type of the corresponding captured entity otherwise.
A member of an anonymous union shall not be captured by copy.

\pnum
Every \grammarterm{id-expression} within the \grammarterm{compound-statement} of a
\grammarterm{lambda-expression} that is an odr-use~(\ref{basic.def.odr}) of an
entity captured by copy is transformed into an access to the corresponding unnamed data
member of the closure type.
\begin{note} An \grammarterm{id-expression} that is not an odr-use refers to
the original entity, never to a member of the closure type. Furthermore, such
an \grammarterm{id-expression} does not cause the implicit capture of the
entity. \end{note}
If \tcode{*this} is captured by copy, each odr-use of \tcode{this} is
transformed into a pointer to the corresponding unnamed data member of the closure type,
cast~(\ref{expr.cast}) to the type of \tcode{this}. \begin{note} The cast ensures that the
transformed expression is a prvalue. \end{note} \begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void f(const int*);
void g() {
  const int N = 10;
  [=] {
    int arr[N];             // OK: not an odr-use, refers to automatic variable
    f(&N);                  // OK: causes \tcode{N} to be captured; \tcode{\&N} points to the

\pnum
An entity is \defnx{captured by reference}{captured!by~reference} if it is implicitly or explicitly
captured but not captured by copy. It is unspecified whether additional unnamed
non-static data members are declared in the closure type for entities captured by
reference.
If declared, such non-static data members shall be of literal type.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
// The inner closure type must be a literal type regardless of how reference captures are represented.
static_assert([](int n) { return [&n] { return ++n; }(); }(3) == 4);
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
A bit-field or a member of an anonymous union shall not be captured by reference.

\pnum
If a \grammarterm{lambda-expression} \tcode{m2} captures an entity and that entity is
captured by an immediately enclosing \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
\tcode{m1}, then
\tcode{m2}'s capture is transformed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item if \tcode{m1} captures the entity by copy,
\tcode{m2} captures the corresponding
non-static data member of \tcode{m1}'s closure type;

\item if \tcode{m1} captures the entity by reference,
\tcode{m2} captures the same
entity captured by \tcode{m1}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example} the nested lambda expressions and invocations below will output

duration is treated as if \tcode{x} were transformed into an access to a corresponding
data member of the closure type that would have been declared if \tcode{x} were an odr-use of
the denoted entity. \begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
void f3() {
  float x, &r = x;
  [=] {                     // \tcode{x} and \tcode{r} are not captured (appearance in a \tcode{decltype} operand is not an odr-use)
    decltype(x) y1;         // \tcode{y1} has type \tcode{float}
    decltype((x)) y2 = y1;  // \tcode{y2} has type \tcode{float const\&} because this lambda

When the \grammarterm{lambda-expression} is evaluated, the entities that are
captured by copy are used to direct-initialize each corresponding non-static data member
of the resulting closure object, and the non-static data members corresponding to the
\grammarterm{init-capture}{s} are initialized as indicated by the corresponding
\grammarterm{initializer} (which may be copy- or direct-initialization). (For array members, the array elements are
direct-initialized in increasing subscript order.) These initializations are performed
in the (unspecified) order in which the non-static data members are declared. \begin{note}
This ensures that the destructions will occur in the reverse order of the constructions.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note} If an entity is implicitly or explicitly captured by reference,
invoking the function call operator of the corresponding \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
after the lifetime of the entity has ended is likely to result in undefined behavior.

A function call is a postfix expression followed by parentheses
containing a possibly empty, comma-separated list of
\grammarterm{initializer-clause}{s} which
constitute the arguments to the function. The postfix expression shall
have function type or function pointer type.
For a call to a non-member function or to a static member function,
the postfix expression shall be either an lvalue that refers to a
function (in which case the function-to-pointer standard
conversion~(\ref{conv.func}) is suppressed on the postfix expression),
or it shall have function pointer type. Calling a function through an
expression whose function type is different
from the function type of the called function's
definition results in undefined behavior~(\ref{dcl.link}). For a call to a non-static
member function,
the postfix expression shall be an
implicit~(\ref{class.mfct.non-static},~\ref{class.static}) or explicit
class member access~(\ref{expr.ref}) whose \grammarterm{id-expression} is a
function member name, or a pointer-to-member
expression~(\ref{expr.mptr.oper}) selecting a function member; the call is as a member of
the class object referred to by the
object expression. In the case of an implicit class
member access, the implied object is the one pointed to by \tcode{this}.
\begin{note}
A member function call of the form \tcode{f()} is interpreted as
\tcode{(*this).f()} (see~\ref{class.mfct.non-static}).
\end{note}
If a function or member function name is used, the name can be
overloaded (Clause~\ref{over}), in which case the appropriate function
shall be selected according to the rules in~\ref{over.match}. If the selected
function is non-virtual, or if the \grammarterm{id-expression} in the class
member access expression is a \grammarterm{qualified-id}, that function is
called. Otherwise, its final overrider~(\ref{class.virtual}) in the dynamic type
of the object expression is called; such a call is referred to as a
\defnx{virtual function call}{function!virtual function~call}.
\begin{note}
The dynamic type is the type of the object referred to by the
current value of the object expression. \ref{class.cdtor}~describes the
behavior of virtual function calls when the object expression
refers to
an object under construction or destruction.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
If a function or member function name is used, and name
lookup~(\ref{basic.lookup}) does not find a declaration of that name,
the program is ill-formed. No function is implicitly declared by such a

\end{note}

\pnum
If the \grammarterm{postfix-expression} designates a destructor~(\ref{class.dtor}),
the type of the function call expression is \tcode{void}; otherwise, the

When a function is called, each parameter~(\ref{dcl.fct}) shall be

its corresponding argument.
If the function is a non-static member
function, the \tcode{this} parameter of the function~(\ref{class.this})
shall be initialized with a pointer to the object of the call, converted
as if by an explicit type conversion~(\ref{expr.cast}).
\begin{note}
There is no access or ambiguity checking on this conversion; the access
checking and disambiguation are done as part of the (possibly implicit)
class member access operator.
See~\ref{class.member.lookup},~\ref{class.access.base},
and~\ref{expr.ref}.
\end{note}
When a function is called, the parameters that have object type shall
have completely-defined object type.
\begin{note}
this still allows a parameter to be a pointer or reference to an
incomplete class type. However, it prevents a passed-by-value parameter
to have an incomplete class type.
\end{note}
It is \impldef{whether the lifetime of a parameter ends when the callee
returns or at the end of the enclosing full-expression} whether the
lifetime of a parameter ends when the function in which it is defined
returns or at the end of the enclosing full-expression.
The initialization and destruction of each parameter occurs
within the context of the calling function.
\begin{example}
the access of the constructor, conversion functions or destructor is
checked at the point of call in the calling function. If a constructor
or destructor for a function parameter throws an exception, the search
for a handler starts in the scope of the calling function; in
particular, if the function called has a \grammarterm{function-try-block}
(Clause~\ref{except}) with a handler that could handle the exception,
this handler is not considered.

a const-qualified type, \tcode{const_cast} is required to be used to
cast away the constness in order to modify the argument's value. Where a
parameter is of \tcode{const} reference type a temporary object is
introduced if
needed~(\ref{dcl.type},~\ref{lex.literal},~\ref{lex.string},~\ref{dcl.array},~\ref{class.temporary}).

parameters in the function definition~(\ref{dcl.fct.def}).
\begin{note}
this implies that, except where the ellipsis (\tcode{...}) or a function
parameter pack is used, a parameter is available for each argument.

\indextext{ellipsis!conversion~sequence}%
When there is no parameter for a given argument, the argument is passed
in such a way that the receiving function can obtain the value of the
argument by invoking \tcode{va_arg}~(\ref{support.runtime}).
\begin{note} This paragraph does not apply to arguments passed to a function parameter pack.
Function parameter packs are expanded during template instantiation~(\ref{temp.variadic}),
thus each such argument has a corresponding parameter when a function template
specialization is actually called. \end{note}
The
lvalue-to-rvalue~(\ref{conv.lval}), array-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.array}),
and function-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.func}) standard conversions are
performed on the argument expression.
An argument that has (possibly cv-qualified) type \tcode{std::nullptr_t} is converted
to type \tcode{void*}~(\ref{conv.ptr}).
After these conversions, if the
argument does not have arithmetic, enumeration, pointer, pointer to
member, or class type, the program is ill-formed. Passing a potentially-evaluated
argument of class type (Clause~\ref{class}) having a non-trivial
copy constructor, a non-trivial move constructor,
or a
non-trivial destructor, with no corresponding parameter, is conditionally-supported with
\impldef{passing argument of class type through ellipsis} semantics. If the argument has
integral or enumeration type that is subject to the integral
promotions~(\ref{conv.prom}), or a floating point type that is subject to the floating
point promotion~(\ref{conv.fpprom}), the value of the argument is converted to the
promoted type before the call. These promotions are referred to as

\begin{itemize}

\tcode{v} points (refers) to a \tcode{public} base class subobject of a
\tcode{C} object, and if only one object of type \tcode{C} is derived
from the subobject pointed (referred) to by \tcode{v} the result points (refers) to that \tcode{C} object.

class subobject of the most derived object, and the type of the most

the explicit conversion does not cast away
constness~(\ref{expr.const.cast}), and the following additional rules
for specific cases:

\pnum
A value of a scoped enumeration type~(\ref{dcl.enum}) can be explicitly converted to an
integral type. When that type is \cv{} \tcode{bool}, the resulting value is
\tcode{false} if the original value is zero and \tcode{true} for all other
values. For the remaining integral types, the value is unchanged if the
original value can be represented by the
specified type. Otherwise, the resulting value is unspecified.
A value of a scoped enumeration type can also be explicitly converted to a
floating-point type; the result is the same as that of converting from the original
value to the floating-point type.

\pnum
\indextext{enumeration~type!conversion~to}%
\indextext{enumeration~type!\idxcode{static_cast}!conversion~to}%
A value of integral or enumeration type can be explicitly converted to
a complete enumeration type. The value is unchanged if the original value is
within the range of the enumeration values~(\ref{dcl.enum}). Otherwise,
the behavior is undefined.
A value of floating-point type can also be explicitly converted to an enumeration type.
The resulting value is the same as converting the original value to the
underlying type of the enumeration~(\ref{conv.fpint}), and subsequently to
the enumeration type.

\pnum
\indextext{cast!base~class}%
\indextext{cast!derived~class}%
A prvalue of type ``pointer to \cvqual{cv1} \tcode{B}'', where \tcode{B}
is a class type, can be converted to a prvalue of type ``pointer to
\cvqual{cv2} \tcode{D}'', where \tcode{D} is a class derived
(Clause~\ref{class.derived}) from \tcode{B},
if \cvqual{cv2} is the same cv-qualification as,
or greater cv-qualification than, \cvqual{cv1}.
If \tcode{B} is a virtual base class of \tcode{D} or
a base class of a virtual base class of \tcode{D}, or
if no valid standard conversion from ``pointer to \tcode{D}''
to ``pointer to \tcode{B}'' exists~(\ref{conv.ptr}), the program is ill-formed. 
The null pointer value~(\ref{conv.ptr}) is converted
to the null pointer value of the destination type. If the prvalue of type
``pointer to \cvqual{cv1} \tcode{B}'' points to a \tcode{B} that is
actually a subobject of an object of type \tcode{D}, the resulting
pointer points to the enclosing object of type \tcode{D}. Otherwise, the
behavior is undefined.

\pnum
\indextext{cast!pointer-to-member}%
A prvalue of type ``pointer to member of \tcode{D} of type \cvqual{cv1}
\tcode{T}'' can be converted to a prvalue of type ``pointer to member of
\tcode{B} of type \cvqual{cv2} \tcode{T}'', where \tcode{B} is a base
class (Clause~\ref{class.derived}) of \tcode{D},
if \cvqual{cv2} is the same cv-qualification
as, or greater cv-qualification than, \cvqual{cv1}.\footnote{Function types
(including those used in pointer to member function
types) are never cv-qualified; see~\ref{dcl.fct}.}
If no valid standard conversion
from ``pointer to member of \tcode{B} of type \tcode{T}''
to ``pointer to member of \tcode{D} of type \tcode{T}''
exists~(\ref{conv.mem}), the program is ill-formed.
The null member pointer value~(\ref{conv.mem}) is converted to the null
member pointer value of the destination type. If class \tcode{B}
contains the original member, or is a base or derived class of the class
containing the original member, the resulting pointer to member points
to the original member. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
\begin{note}
although class \tcode{B} need not contain the original member, the
dynamic type of the object with which indirection through the pointer
to member is performed must contain the original member;
see~\ref{expr.mptr.oper}.
\end{note}

\pnum
A prvalue of type ``pointer to \cvqual{cv1} \tcode{void}'' can be
converted to a prvalue of type ``pointer to \cvqual{cv2} \tcode{T}'',
where \tcode{T} is an object type and \cvqual{cv2} is the same
cv-qualification as, or greater cv-qualification than, \cvqual{cv1}.
If the original pointer value represents the address
\tcode{A} of a byte in memory and
\tcode{A} does not satisfy the alignment requirement of \tcode{T},
then the resulting pointer value is unspecified.
Otherwise, if the original pointer value points to an object \placeholder{a},
and there is an object \placeholder{b} of type \tcode{T} (ignoring cv-qualification)
that is pointer-interconvertible~(\ref{basic.compound}) with \placeholder{a},
the result is a pointer to \placeholder{b}.
Otherwise, the pointer value is unchanged by the conversion. 
\begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
T* p1 = new T;
const T* p2 = static_cast<const T*>(static_cast<void*>(p1));
bool b = p1 == p2;  // \tcode{b} will have the value \tcode{true}.

\indextext{type!incomplete}%
Indirection through a pointer to an incomplete type (other than
\cvqual{cv} \tcode{void}) is valid. The lvalue thus obtained can be

The result of each of the following unary operators is a prvalue.

\pnum
\indextext{name!address~of cv-qualified}%
\indextext{expression!pointer~to~member constant}%
The result of the unary \tcode{\&} operator is a pointer to its operand.
The operand shall be an lvalue or a \grammarterm{qualified-id}.
If the operand is a \grammarterm{qualified-id} naming a non-static or variant member \tcode{m}
of some class \tcode{C} with type \tcode{T}, the result has type ``pointer to member
of class \tcode{C} of type \tcode{T}'' and is a prvalue designating \tcode{C::m}.
Otherwise, if the type of the expression is \tcode{T}, the result has type ``pointer to
\tcode{T}'' and is a prvalue that is the address of the designated object~(\ref{intro.memory})
or a pointer to the designated function. \begin{note} In particular, the address of an
object of type ``\cv{} \tcode{T}'' is ``pointer to \cv{} \tcode{T}'', with the same
cv-qualification. \end{note}
For purposes of pointer arithmetic~(\ref{expr.add}) and
comparison~(\ref{expr.rel}, \ref{expr.eq}),
an object that is not an array element whose
address is taken in this way is considered to belong to an array with one
element of type \tcode{T}.
\begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
struct A { int i; };
struct B : A { };
... &B::i ...       // has type \tcode{int A::*}
int a;
int* p1 = &a;
int* p2 = p1 + 1;   // defined behavior
bool b = p2 > p1;   // defined behavior, with value \tcode{true}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
A pointer to member formed from a \tcode{mutable} non-static data
member~(\ref{dcl.stc}) does not reflect the \tcode{mutable} specifier
associated with the non-static data member.
\end{note}

\pnum
A pointer to member is only formed when an explicit \tcode{\&} is used
and its operand is a \grammarterm{qualified-id} not enclosed in
parentheses.
\begin{note}
That is, the expression \tcode{\&(qualified-id)}, where the
\grammarterm{qualified-id} is enclosed in parentheses, does not form an
expression of type ``pointer to member''. Neither does
\tcode{qualified-id}, because there is no implicit conversion from a
\grammarterm{qualified-id} for a non-static member function to the type
``pointer to member function'' as there is from an lvalue of function
type to the type ``pointer to function''~(\ref{conv.func}). Nor is
\tcode{\&unqualified-id} a pointer to member, even within the scope of
the \grammarterm{unqualified-id}'s class.
\end{note}

\pnum
If \tcode{\&} is applied to an lvalue of incomplete class type and the
complete type declares \tcode{operator\&()}, it is unspecified whether
the operator has the built-in meaning or the operator function is
called. The operand of \tcode{\&} shall not be a bit-field.

\pnum
\indextext{overloaded~function!address~of}%
The address of an overloaded function (Clause~\ref{over}) can be taken
only in a context that uniquely determines which version of the
overloaded function is referred to (see~\ref{over.over}).
\begin{note}
Since the context might determine whether the operand is a static or
non-static member function, the context can also affect whether the
expression has type ``pointer to function'' or ``pointer to member
function''.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{operator!unary~plus}%
The operand of the unary \tcode{+} operator shall have arithmetic, unscoped
enumeration, or pointer type and the result is the value of the
argument. Integral promotion is performed on integral or enumeration
operands. The type of the result is the type of the promoted operand.

\pnum
\indextext{operator!unary~minus}%
The operand of the unary \tcode{-} operator shall have arithmetic or unscoped
enumeration type and the result is the negation of its operand. Integral
promotion is performed on integral or enumeration operands. The negative
of an unsigned quantity is computed by subtracting its value from $2^n$,
where $n$ is the number of bits in the promoted operand. The type of the
result is the type of the promoted operand.

\pnum
\indextext{operator!logical negation}%
The operand of the logical negation operator \tcode{!} is contextually
converted to \tcode{bool}
(Clause~\ref{conv}); its value is \tcode{true}
if the converted operand is \tcode{false} and \tcode{false} otherwise.
The type of the result is \tcode{bool}.

\pnum
\indextext{signed integer representation!ones' complement}%
\indextext{operator!ones'~complement}%
The operand of \tcode{\~{}} shall have integral or unscoped enumeration type; the
result is the ones' complement of its operand. Integral promotions are
performed. The type of the result is the type of the promoted operand.
There is an ambiguity
in the grammar when \tcode{\~{}} is followed by
a \grammarterm{class-name} or \grammarterm{decltype-specifier}.
The ambiguity is resolved by treating \tcode{\~{}} as the unary complement
operator rather than as the start of an \grammarterm{unqualified-id}
naming a destructor.
\begin{note}
Because the grammar does not permit an operator to follow the
\tcode{.}, \tcode{->}, or \tcode{::} tokens, a \tcode{\~{}} followed by
a \grammarterm{class-name} or \grammarterm{decltype-specifier} in a
member access expression or \grammarterm{qualified-id} is
unambiguously parsed as a destructor name.

\indextext{type!incomplete}%
The \tcode{sizeof} operator shall not be applied to an expression that

types, or to a glvalue that designates a bit-field.
\tcode{sizeof(char)}, \tcode{sizeof(signed char)} and

\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{reference!\idxcode{sizeof}}%
When applied to a reference or a reference type, the result is the size
of the referenced type.
\indextext{class~object!\idxcode{sizeof}}%
When applied to a class, the result is the number of bytes in an object
of that class including any padding required for placing objects of that
type in an array. The size of a most derived class shall be greater than
zero~(\ref{intro.object}). The result of applying \tcode{sizeof} to a
base class subobject is the size of the base class type.\footnote{The actual
size of a base class subobject may be less than the result of
applying \tcode{sizeof} to the subobject, due to virtual base classes
and less strict padding requirements on base class subobjects.}
\indextext{array!\idxcode{sizeof}}%
When applied to an array, the result is the total number of bytes in the
array. This implies that the size of an array of \term{n} elements is
\term{n} times the size of an element.

The \tcode{sizeof} operator can be applied to a pointer to a function,

\tcode{T} be the \nonterminal{new-type-id} or \nonterminal{type-id} of
the \nonterminal{new-expression}, then the allocated type is the type
deduced for the variable \tcode{x} in the invented
declaration~(\ref{dcl.spec.auto}):

\begin{codeblock}
T x(e);
\end{codeblock}

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
new auto(1);                    // allocated type is \tcode{int}

parentheses in a \grammarterm{new-type-id} of a \grammarterm{new-expression}

An implementation is allowed to omit a call to a replaceable global allocation

\begin{itemize}
\item the evaluation of \tcode{e1} is sequenced before the evaluation of
\tcode{e2}, and

\item \tcode{e2} is evaluated whenever \tcode{e1} obtains storage, and

\item a \tcode{reinterpret_cast} followed by a \tcode{const_cast},
\end{itemize}

can be performed using the cast notation of explicit type conversion.
The same semantic restrictions and behaviors apply, with the exception
that in performing a \tcode{static_cast} in the following situations the
conversion is valid even if the base class is inaccessible:

\begin{itemize}
\item a pointer to an object of derived class type or an lvalue or
rvalue of derived class type may be explicitly converted to a pointer or
reference to an unambiguous base class type, respectively;

\item a pointer to member of derived class type may be explicitly
converted to a pointer to member of an unambiguous non-virtual base
class type;

\item a pointer to an object of an unambiguous non-virtual base class
type, a glvalue of an unambiguous non-virtual base class type,
or a pointer to member of an unambiguous non-virtual base class type may
be explicitly converted to a pointer, a reference, or a pointer to
member of a derived class type, respectively.
\end{itemize}

If a conversion can be interpreted in more than one of the ways listed
above, the interpretation that appears first in the list is used, even
if a cast resulting from that interpretation is ill-formed. If a
conversion can be interpreted in more than one way as a
\tcode{static_cast} followed by a \tcode{const_cast}, the conversion is
ill-formed.
\begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
struct A { };
struct I1 : A { };
struct I2 : A { };
struct D : I1, I2 { };
A* foo( D* p ) {
  return (A*)( p ); // ill-formed \tcode{static_cast} interpretation

both the operand and destination types are class types and one or both
are incomplete, it is unspecified whether the \tcode{static_cast} or the
\tcode{reinterpret_cast} interpretation is used, even if there is an
inheritance relationship between the two classes.
\begin{note}
For example, if the classes were defined later in the translation unit,
a multi-pass compiler would be permitted to interpret a cast between
pointers to the classes as if the class types were complete at the point
of the cast.

In a \tcode{.*} expression whose object expression is an rvalue, the program is

\begin{itemize}
\indextext{conditional-expression!throw-expression~in}%
\item The second or the third operand (but not both) is a (possibly
parenthesized) \grammarterm{throw-expression}~(\ref{expr.throw}); the result
is of the type and value category of the other.
The \grammarterm{conditional-expression}
is a bit-field if that operand is a bit-field.

\item Both the second and the third operands have type \tcode{void}; the
result is of type \tcode{void} and is a prvalue. \begin{note} This
includes the case where both operands are \grammarterm{throw-expression}{s}.
\end{note}
\end{itemize}

\pnum
Otherwise, if the second and third operand are glvalue bit-fields
of the same value category and
of types \cvqual{cv1} \tcode{T} and \cvqual{cv2} \tcode{T}, respectively,
the operands are considered to be of type \cvqual{cv} \tcode{T}
for the remainder of this section,
where \cvqual{cv} is the union of \cvqual{cv1} and \cvqual{cv2}.

\pnum
Otherwise, if the second and third operand have different types and
either has (possibly cv-qualified) class type, or if both
are glvalues of the same value category and the same type except for
cv-qualification, an attempt is made to
form an implicit conversion sequence~(\ref{over.best.ics}) from
each of those operands to the type of the other.
\begin{note}
Properties such as access, whether an operand is a bit-field, or whether
a conversion function is deleted are ignored for that determination.
\end{note}
Attempts are made to form an implicit conversion sequence
from an operand expression \tcode{E1} of type \tcode{T1}
to a target type related to the type \tcode{T2}
of the operand expression \tcode{E2} as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{E2} is an lvalue, the target type is 
``lvalue reference to \tcode{T2}'', subject to the
constraint that in the conversion the reference must bind
directly~(\ref{dcl.init.ref}) to an lvalue.

\item If \tcode{E2} is an xvalue, the target type is
``rvalue reference to \tcode{T2}'',
subject to the constraint that the reference must bind directly.

\item If \tcode{E2} is a prvalue or if neither of the conversion sequences above can be
formed and at least one of the operands has (possibly cv-qualified) class type:

\begin{itemize}
\item if \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2} are the same class type
(ignoring cv-qualification), or one is a base class of the other, and
\tcode{T2} is at least as cv-qualified as \tcode{T1},
the target type is \tcode{T2},
    
\item otherwise, the target type is the type that \tcode{E2} would have
after applying the
lvalue-to-rvalue~(\ref{conv.lval}),
array-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.array}), and
function-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.func})
standard conversions.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Using this process, it is determined whether an implicit conversion
sequence can be formed from the second operand 
to the target type determined for the third operand, and vice versa.
If both sequences can be formed, or one can be formed but it is the
ambiguous conversion sequence, the program is ill-formed.
If no conversion sequence can be formed, the operands are left unchanged
and further checking is performed as described below.
Otherwise, if exactly one conversion sequence can be formed,
that conversion is applied to the chosen operand
and the converted operand is used in place of the original operand for
the remainder of this section.
\begin{note}
The conversion might be ill-formed even if an implicit conversion
sequence could be formed.
\end{note}

\pnum
If the second and third operands are glvalues of the same value category
and have the same type, the
result is of that type and value category and it is a bit-field if the
second or the third operand is a bit-field, or if both are bit-fields.

\pnum
Otherwise, the result is a prvalue. If the second and third operands do
not have the same type, and either has (possibly cv-qualified) class
type, overload resolution is used to determine the conversions (if any)
to be applied to the operands~(\ref{over.match.oper},~\ref{over.built}).
If the overload resolution fails, the program is ill-formed. Otherwise,
the conversions thus determined are applied, and the converted operands
are used in place of the original operands for the remainder of this
section.

\pnum
Lvalue-to-rvalue~(\ref{conv.lval}), array-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.array}),
and function-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.func}) standard conversions are
performed on the second and third operands. After those conversions, one
of the following shall hold:

\begin{itemize}
\item The second and third operands have the same type; the result is of
that type and the result object is initialized using the selected operand.

\item The second and third operands have arithmetic or enumeration type;
the usual arithmetic conversions are performed to bring them to a common
type, and the result is of that type.

\item One or both of the second and third operands have pointer type;
pointer conversions~(\ref{conv.ptr}),
function pointer conversions~(\ref{conv.fctptr}), and
qualification conversions~(\ref{conv.qual})
are performed to bring them to their
composite pointer type (Clause~\ref{expr}). The result is of the composite
pointer type.

\item One or both of the second and third operands have pointer to member type;
pointer to member conversions~(\ref{conv.mem}) and qualification
conversions~(\ref{conv.qual}) are performed to bring them to their composite
pointer type (Clause~\ref{expr}). The result is of the composite pointer type.

\item
Both the second and third operands have type \tcode{std::nullptr_t} or one has
that type and the other is a null pointer constant. The result is of type
\tcode{std::nullptr_t}.

An \defnx{integral constant expression}{expression!integral~constant}
is an expression of integral or
unscoped enumeration type, implicitly converted to a prvalue, where the converted expression is a core constant expression.
\begin{note}
Such expressions may be
used as bit-field lengths~(\ref{class.bit}), as enumerator
initializers if the underlying type is not fixed~(\ref{dcl.enum}),
and as alignments~(\ref{dcl.align}).
\end{note}

\pnum
A \defnx{converted constant expression}{expression!converted~constant}
of type \tcode{T} is an
expression, implicitly converted to type \tcode{T}, where
the converted expression is a constant expression and the
implicit conversion sequence contains only

\begin{itemize}
\item user-defined conversions,
\item lvalue-to-rvalue conversions~(\ref{conv.lval}),
\item array-to-pointer conversions~(\ref{conv.array}),
\item function-to-pointer conversions~(\ref{conv.func}),
\item qualification conversions~(\ref{conv.qual}),
\item integral promotions~(\ref{conv.prom}),
\item integral conversions~(\ref{conv.integral}) other than narrowing conversions~(\ref{dcl.init.list}),
\item null pointer conversions~(\ref{conv.ptr}) from \tcode{std::nullptr_t},
\item null member pointer conversions~(\ref{conv.mem}) from \tcode{std::nullptr_t}, and
\item function pointer conversions~(\ref{conv.fctptr}),
\end{itemize}

and where the reference binding (if any) binds directly.
\begin{note}
Such expressions may be used in \tcode{new}
expressions~(\ref{expr.new}), as case expressions~(\ref{stmt.switch}),
as enumerator initializers if the underlying type is
fixed~(\ref{dcl.enum}), as array bounds~(\ref{dcl.array}), and
as non-type template
arguments~(\ref{temp.arg}).

A \term{contextually converted constant expression of type \tcode{bool}} is
an expression, contextually converted to \tcode{bool}~(Clause\ref{conv}),
where the converted expression is a constant expression and
the conversion sequence contains only the conversions above.

\indextext{expression!constant}%
A \term{constant expression} is either
a glvalue core constant expression that refers to
an entity that is a permitted result of a constant expression (as defined below), or
a prvalue core constant expression whose value
satisfies the following constraints:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  if the value is an object of class type,
  each non-static data member of reference type refers to
  an entity that is a permitted result of a constant expression,

  \item
  if the value is of pointer type, it contains
  the address of an object with static storage duration,
  the address past the end of such an object~(\ref{expr.add}),
  the address of a function,
  or a null pointer value, and

  \item
  if the value is an object of class or array type,
  each subobject satisfies these constraints for the value.
\end{itemize}
An entity is a
\defnx{permitted result of a constant expression}{constant expression!permitted result~of}
if it is an
object with static storage duration that is either not a temporary object or is
a temporary object whose value satisfies the above constraints, or it is a
function.

\begin{note} Since this International Standard
imposes no restrictions on the accuracy of floating-point operations, it is unspecified whether the
evaluation of a floating-point expression during translation yields the same result as the
evaluation of the same expression (or the same operations on the same values) during program
execution.\footnote{Nonetheless, implementations are encouraged to provide consistent results,
irrespective of whether the evaluation was performed during translation and/or during program
execution.} \begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
bool f() {
    char array[1 + int(1 + 0.2 - 0.1 - 0.1)];  // Must be evaluated during translation
    int size = 1 + int(1 + 0.2 - 0.1 - 0.1);   // May be evaluated at runtime
    return sizeof(array) == size;
}
\end{codeblock}
It is unspecified whether the value of \tcode{f()} will be \tcode{true} or \tcode{false}.
\end{example} \end{note}

\pnum
If an expression of literal class type is used in a context where an 
integral constant expression is required, then that expression is
contextually implicitly converted (Clause~\ref{conv}) to an integral or unscoped
enumeration type 
and the selected conversion function shall be \tcode{constexpr}. \begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A { 
  constexpr A(int i) : val(i) { } 
  constexpr operator int() const { return val; }
  constexpr operator long() const { return 43; }
private: 
  int val; 
}; 
template<int> struct X { }; 
constexpr A a = 42; 
X<a> x;             // OK: unique conversion to \tcode{int}
int ary[a];         // error: ambiguous conversion 
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}%
