\ref{expr} defines the syntax, order of evaluation, and meaning
of expressions.
\begin{footnote}
The precedence of operators is not directly specified, but it can be
derived from the syntax.
\end{footnote}
An expression is a sequence of operators and operands that specifies a
computation. An expression can result in a value and can cause side
effects.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{operator!overloaded}%
\begin{note}
Operators can be overloaded, that is, given meaning when applied to
expressions of class type\iref{class} or enumeration
type\iref{dcl.enum}. Uses of overloaded operators are transformed into
function calls as described in~\ref{over.oper}. Overloaded operators
obey the rules for syntax and evaluation order specified in \ref{expr.compound},
but the requirements of operand type and value category are replaced
by the rules for function call. Relations between operators, such as
\tcode{++a} meaning \tcode{a+=1}, are not guaranteed for overloaded
operators\iref{over.oper}.
\end{note}

\pnum
Subclause \ref{expr.compound} defines the effects of operators when applied to types
for which they have not been overloaded. Operator overloading shall not
modify the rules for the \defnadj{built-in}{operators},
that is, for operators applied to types for which they are defined by this
Standard. However, these built-in operators participate in overload
resolution, and as part of that process user-defined conversions will be
considered where necessary to convert the operands to types appropriate
for the built-in operator. If a built-in operator is selected, such
conversions will be applied to the operands before the operation is
considered further according to the rules in subclause \ref{expr.compound};
see~\ref{over.match.oper}, \ref{over.built}.

Treatment of division by zero, forming a remainder using a zero divisor,

\begin{note}
The implementation can regroup operators according to
the usual mathematical rules only
where the operators really are associative or commutative.
\begin{footnote}
Overloaded
operators are never assumed to be associative or commutative.
\end{footnote}
For example, in the following fragment
\begin{codeblock}
int a, b;
@\commentellip@
a = a + 32760 + b + 5;
\end{codeblock}
the expression statement behaves exactly the same as
\begin{codeblock}
a = (((a + 32760) + b) + 5);
\end{codeblock}
due to the associativity and precedence of these operators. Thus, the
result of the sum \tcode{(a + 32760)} is next added to \tcode{b}, and
that result is then added to 5 which results in the value assigned to
\tcode{a}. On a machine in which overflows produce an exception and in
which the range of values representable by an \tcode{int} is
\crange{-32768}{+32767}, the implementation cannot rewrite this
expression as
\begin{codeblock}
a = ((a + b) + 32765);
\end{codeblock}
since if the values for \tcode{a} and \tcode{b} were, respectively,
-32754 and -15, the sum \tcode{a + b} would produce an exception while
the original expression would not; nor can the expression be rewritten
as either
\begin{codeblock}
a = ((a + 32765) + b);
\end{codeblock}
or
\begin{codeblock}
a = (a + (b + 32765));
\end{codeblock}
since the values for \tcode{a} and \tcode{b} might have been,
respectively, 4 and -8 or -17 and 12. However on a machine in which
overflows do not produce an exception and in which the results of
overflows are reversible, the above expression statement can be
rewritten by the implementation in any of the above ways because the
same result will occur.
\end{note}

\pnum
The values of the floating-point operands and
the results of floating-point expressions
may be represented in greater precision and range than that
required by the type; the types are not changed\
thereby.
\begin{footnote}
The cast and assignment operators must still perform their specific
conversions as described in~\ref{expr.type.conv}, \ref{expr.cast},
\ref{expr.static.cast} and~\ref{expr.ass}.
\end{footnote}

\rSec1[expr.prop]{Properties of expressions}

\rSec2[basic.lval]{Value category}
\pnum
Expressions are categorized according to the taxonomy in \fref{basic.lval}.

\begin{importgraphic}
{Expression category taxonomy}
{basic.lval}
{valuecategories.pdf}
\end{importgraphic}

\begin{itemize}
\item A \defn{glvalue} is an expression whose evaluation determines the identity of an object or function.
\item A \defn{prvalue} is an expression whose evaluation initializes an object
or computes the value of an operand of an operator,
as specified by the context in which it appears,
or an expression that has type \cv{}~\keyword{void}.
\item An \defn{xvalue} is a glvalue that denotes an object whose resources can be reused (usually because it is near the end of its lifetime).
\item An \defn{lvalue} is a glvalue that is not an xvalue.
\item An \defn{rvalue} is a prvalue or an xvalue.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
Every expression belongs to exactly one of the fundamental classifications in this
taxonomy: lvalue, xvalue, or prvalue. This property of an expression is called
its \defn{value category}.
\begin{note}
The discussion of each built-in operator in
\ref{expr.compound} indicates the category of the value it yields and the value categories
of the operands it expects. For example, the built-in assignment operators expect that
the left operand is an lvalue and that the right operand is a prvalue and yield an
lvalue as the result. User-defined operators are functions, and the categories of
values they expect and yield are determined by their parameter and return types.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
Historically, lvalues and rvalues were so-called
because they could appear on the left- and right-hand side of an assignment
(although this is no longer generally true);
glvalues are ``generalized'' lvalues,
prvalues are ``pure'' rvalues,
and xvalues are ``eXpiring'' lvalues.
Despite their names, these terms classify expressions, not values.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{expression!rvalue reference}%
\begin{note}
An expression is an xvalue if it is:
\begin{itemize}
\item the result of calling a function, whether implicitly or explicitly,
whose return type is an rvalue reference to object type\iref{expr.call},

\item a cast to an rvalue reference to object type
(\ref{expr.type.conv}, \ref{expr.dynamic.cast}, \ref{expr.static.cast}
\ref{expr.reinterpret.cast}, \ref{expr.const.cast}, \ref{expr.cast}),

\item a subscripting operation with an xvalue array operand\iref{expr.sub},

\item a class member access expression designating a non-static data member
of non-reference type
in which the object expression is an xvalue\iref{expr.ref}, or

\item a \tcode{.*} pointer-to-member expression in which the first operand is
an xvalue and the second operand is a pointer to data member\iref{expr.mptr.oper}.
\end{itemize}
In general, the effect of this rule is that named rvalue references are
treated as lvalues and unnamed rvalue references to objects are treated as
xvalues; rvalue references to functions are treated as lvalues whether named or not.
\end{note}

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A {
  int m;
};
A&& operator+(A, A);
A&& f();

A a;
A&& ar = static_cast<A&&>(a);
\end{codeblock}

The expressions \tcode{f()}, \tcode{f().m}, \tcode{\keyword{static_cast}<A\&\&>(a)}, and \tcode{a + a}
are xvalues. The expression \tcode{ar} is an lvalue.
\end{example}

\pnum
The \defnx{result}{result!glvalue} of a glvalue is the entity denoted by the expression.
The \defnx{result}{result!prvalue} of a prvalue
is the value that the expression stores into its context;
a prvalue that has type \cv{}~\keyword{void} has no result.
A prvalue whose result is the value \placeholder{V}
is sometimes said to have or name the value \placeholder{V}.
The \defn{result object} of a prvalue is the object initialized by the prvalue;
a non-discarded prvalue
that is used to compute the value of an operand of a built-in operator
or a prvalue that has type \cv{}~\keyword{void}
has no result object.
\begin{note}
Except when the prvalue is the operand of a \grammarterm{decltype-specifier},
a prvalue of class or array type always has a result object.
For a discarded prvalue that has type other than \cv{}~\keyword{void},
a temporary object is materialized; see \ref{expr.context}.
\end{note}

\pnum
Whenever a glvalue appears as an operand of an operator that
expects a prvalue for that operand, the
lvalue-to-rvalue\iref{conv.lval}, array-to-pointer\iref{conv.array},
or function-to-pointer\iref{conv.func} standard conversions are
applied to convert the expression to a prvalue.
\begin{note}
An attempt to bind an rvalue reference to an lvalue is not such a context; see~\ref{dcl.init.ref}.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
Because cv-qualifiers are removed from the type of an expression of
non-class type when the expression is converted to a prvalue, an lvalue
of type \tcode{\keyword{const} \keyword{int}} can, for example, be used where
a prvalue of type \keyword{int} is required.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
There are no prvalue bit-fields; if a bit-field is converted to a
prvalue\iref{conv.lval}, a prvalue of the type of the bit-field is
created, which might then be promoted\iref{conv.prom}.
\end{note}

\pnum
Whenever a prvalue appears as an operand of an operator that
expects a glvalue for that operand, the
temporary materialization conversion\iref{conv.rval} is
applied to convert the expression to an xvalue.

\pnum
The discussion of reference initialization in~\ref{dcl.init.ref} and of
temporaries in~\ref{class.temporary} indicates the behavior of lvalues
and rvalues in other significant contexts.

\pnum
Unless otherwise indicated\iref{dcl.type.decltype},
a prvalue shall always have complete type or the \keyword{void} type;
if it has a class type or (possibly multi-dimensional) array of class type,
that class shall not be an abstract class\iref{class.abstract}.
A glvalue shall not have type \cv{}~\keyword{void}.
\begin{note}
A glvalue can have complete or incomplete non-\keyword{void} type.
Class and array prvalues can have cv-qualified types; other prvalues
always have cv-unqualified types. See \ref{expr.type}.
\end{note}

\pnum
An lvalue is \defn{modifiable} unless its type is const-qualified
or is a function type.
\begin{note}
A program that attempts
to modify an object through a nonmodifiable lvalue or through an rvalue
is ill-formed~(\ref{expr.ass}, \ref{expr.post.incr}, \ref{expr.pre.incr}).
\end{note}

\pnum
If a program attempts to access\iref{defns.access}
the stored value of an object through a glvalue
whose type is not similar\iref{conv.qual} to
one of the following types the behavior is
undefined:
\begin{footnote}
The intent of this list is to specify those circumstances in which an
object can or cannot be aliased.
\end{footnote}
\begin{itemize}
\item the dynamic type of the object,

\item a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the
dynamic type of the object, or

\item a \keyword{char}, \tcode{\keyword{unsigned} \keyword{char}}, or \tcode{std::byte} type.
\end{itemize}
If a program invokes
a defaulted copy/move constructor or copy/move assignment operator
for a union of type \tcode{U} with a glvalue argument
that does not denote an object of type \cv{}~\keyword{U} within its lifetime,
the behavior is undefined.
\begin{note}
Unlike in C, \Cpp{} has no accesses of class type.
\end{note}

\rSec2[expr.type]{Type}

\pnum
\indextext{expression!reference}%
If an expression initially has the type ``reference to
\tcode{T}''~(\ref{dcl.ref}, \ref{dcl.init.ref}), the type is adjusted to
\tcode{T} prior to any further analysis. The expression designates the
object or function denoted by the reference, and the expression
is an lvalue or an xvalue, depending on the expression.
\begin{note}
Before the lifetime of the reference has started or after it has ended,
the behavior is undefined (see~\ref{basic.life}).
\end{note}

\pnum
If a prvalue initially has the type ``\cv{}~\tcode{T}'', where
\tcode{T} is a cv-unqualified non-class, non-array type, the type of
the expression is adjusted to \tcode{T} prior to any further analysis.

\pnum
\indextext{pointer!composite pointer type}%
The \defn{composite pointer type} of
two operands \tcode{p1} and

for some non-function type \tcode{U},
where \tcode{C1} is

\tcode{C1}\iref{dcl.init.ref}, the qualification-combined type of \tcode{T2} and \tcode{T1} or the qualification-combined type

if \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2} are similar types\iref{conv.qual}, the qualification-combined type of \tcode{T1} and

otherwise, a program that necessitates the determination of a
composite pointer type is ill-formed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
typedef void *p;
typedef const int *q;
typedef int **pi;
typedef const int **pci;
\end{codeblock}

The composite pointer type of \tcode{p} and \tcode{q} is ``pointer to \tcode{\keyword{const} \keyword{void}}''; the
composite pointer type of \tcode{pi} and \tcode{pci} is ``pointer to \tcode{\keyword{const}} pointer to

\ref{temp.concept}).
An unevaluated operand is not evaluated.
\begin{note}
In an unevaluated operand, a non-static class member can be
named\iref{expr.prim.id} and naming of objects or functions does not, by
itself, require that a definition be provided\iref{basic.def.odr}.
An unevaluated operand is considered a full-expression\iref{intro.execution}.
\end{note}

\pnum
In some contexts, an expression only appears for its side effects. Such an
expression is called a \defn{discarded-value expression}.
The array-to-pointer\iref{conv.array}
and function-to-pointer\iref{conv.func} standard conversions are not
applied. The lvalue-to-rvalue conversion\iref{conv.lval} is applied
if and only if
the expression is a glvalue of volatile-qualified type and it is one of the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{(} \grammarterm{expression} \tcode{)}, where
  \grammarterm{expression} is one of these expressions,

\item comma expression\iref{expr.comma} where the right operand is one of
      these expressions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}
Using an overloaded operator causes a function call; the
above covers only operators with built-in meaning.
\end{note}
If the (possibly converted) expression is a prvalue,
the temporary materialization conversion\iref{conv.rval} is applied.
\begin{note}
If the expression is an lvalue of
class type, it must have a volatile copy constructor to initialize the
temporary object that is the result object of the lvalue-to-rvalue

Standard conversions are implicit conversions with built-in meaning.
\ref{conv} enumerates the full set of such conversions. A

pointer-to-member conversions, and boolean conversions.

\item Zero or one function pointer conversion.

\item Zero or one qualification conversion.
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}
A standard conversion sequence can be empty, i.e., it can consist of no
conversions.
\end{note}
A standard conversion sequence will be applied to
an expression if necessary to convert it to a required destination type.

\pnum
\begin{note}
Expressions with a given type will be implicitly converted to other
types in several contexts:

\begin{itemize}
\item When used as operands of operators. The operator's requirements
for its operands dictate the destination type\iref{expr.compound}.

\item When used in the condition of an \keyword{if} statement\iref{stmt.if} or
iteration statement\iref{stmt.iter}. The destination type is
\keyword{bool}.

\item When used in the expression of a \keyword{switch} statement\iref{stmt.switch}.
The destination type is integral.

\item When used as the source expression for an initialization (which
includes use as an argument in a function call and use as the expression
in a \keyword{return} statement). The type of the entity being initialized
is (generally) the destination type.
See~\ref{dcl.init}, \ref{dcl.init.ref}.

An expression $E$ can be
\defnx{implicitly converted}{conversion!implicit} to a type \tcode{T} if and only if the
declaration \tcode{T t=$E$;} is well-formed, for some invented temporary

\pnum
Certain language constructs require that an expression be converted to a Boolean
value. An expression $E$ appearing in such a context is said to be

the declaration \tcode{\keyword{bool} t($E$);} is well-formed, for some invented temporary
variable \tcode{t}\iref{dcl.init}.

\pnum
Certain language constructs require conversion to a value having
one of a specified set of types appropriate to the construct. An
expression $E$ of class type \tcode{C} appearing in such a
context is said to be
\indextext{conversion!contextual}%
\defn{contextually implicitly converted} to a specified type \tcode{T} and is
well-formed if and only if $E$ can be implicitly converted to a type \tcode{T}
that is determined as follows:
\tcode{C} is searched for non-explicit conversion functions
whose return type is \cv{} \tcode{T} or reference to \cv{}
\tcode{T} such that \tcode{T} is allowed by the context.
There shall be exactly one such \tcode{T}.

\pnum
The effect of any implicit
conversion is the same as performing the corresponding declaration and initialization
and then using the temporary variable as the result of the conversion.
The result is an lvalue if \tcode{T} is an lvalue reference
type or an rvalue reference to function type\iref{dcl.ref},
an xvalue if \tcode{T} is an rvalue reference to object type,
and a prvalue otherwise. The expression $E$
is used as a glvalue if and only if the initialization uses it as a glvalue.

\pnum
\begin{note}
For class types, user-defined conversions are considered as well;
see~\ref{class.conv}. In general, an implicit conversion
sequence\iref{over.best.ics} consists of a standard conversion
sequence followed by a user-defined conversion followed by another
standard conversion sequence.
\end{note}

There are some contexts where certain conversions are suppressed. For

A glvalue\iref{basic.lval} of a non-function, non-array type \tcode{T}
can be converted to
a prvalue.
\begin{footnote}
For historical reasons, this conversion is called the ``lvalue-to-rvalue''
conversion, even though that name does not accurately reflect the taxonomy
of expressions described in~\ref{basic.lval}.
\end{footnote}
If \tcode{T} is an incomplete type, a
program that necessitates this conversion is ill-formed. If \tcode{T}
is a non-class type, the type of the prvalue is
the cv-unqualified version of \tcode{T}. Otherwise, the type of the
prvalue is \tcode{T}.
\begin{footnote}
In \Cpp{} class and array prvalues can have cv-qualified types.
This differs from ISO C, in which non-lvalues never have
cv-qualified types.

\pnum
When an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion
is applied to an expression $E$, and either
\begin{itemize}
\item $E$ is not potentially evaluated, or

The result of the conversion is determined according to the
following rules:

\begin{itemize}

\item If \tcode{T} is \cv{}~\tcode{std::nullptr_t}, the result is a
null pointer constant\iref{conv.ptr}.
\begin{note}
Since the conversion does not access the object to which the glvalue refers,
there is no side effect even if \tcode{T} is volatile-qualified\iref{intro.execution}, and
the glvalue can refer to an inactive member of a union\iref{class.union}.
\end{note}

\item Otherwise, if \tcode{T} has a class
type, the conversion copy-initializes the result object from
the glvalue.

\item Otherwise, if the object to which the glvalue refers contains an invalid
pointer value~(\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation}), the behavior is
\impldef{lvalue-to-rvalue conversion of an invalid pointer value}.

\item Otherwise, the object indicated by the glvalue is read\iref{defns.access},

If \tcode{T} is a class type (or array thereof),
it must have an accessible and non-deleted destructor;

If $P_i$ designates an array,
the cv-qualifiers $\cv{}_{i+1}$ on the element type are also taken as
the cv-qualifiers $\cv{}_i$ of the array.
\begin{example}
The type denoted by the \grammarterm{type-id} \tcode{const int **}

taking \tcode{U}
as ``\keyword{int}'',
as ``pointer to \tcode{\keyword{const} \keyword{int}}'', and
as ``pointer to pointer to \tcode{\keyword{const} \keyword{int}}''.
\end{example}
The $n$-tuple of cv-qualifiers after the first one
in the longest qualification-decomposition of \tcode{T}, that is,
$\cv{}_1, \cv{}_2, \dotsc, \cv{}_n$, is called the
\defn{cv-qualification signature} of \tcode{T}.

\end{itemize}
where $\cv{}^j_i$ and $P^j_i$ are the components of
the qualification-decomposition of $\tcode{T}j$.
A prvalue of type \tcode{T1}
can be converted to type \tcode{T2}

\begin{note}
If a program could assign a pointer of type \tcode{T**} to a pointer of
type \keyword{const} \tcode{T**} (that is, if line \#1 below were
allowed), a program could inadvertently modify a const object
(as it is done on line \#2). For example,
\begin{codeblock}
int main() {

}
\end{codeblock}

The result of the conversion refers to the same member as the pointer to
member before the conversion took place, but it refers to the base class
member as if it were a member of the derived class. The result refers to
the member in \tcode{D}'s instance of \tcode{B}. Since the result has
type ``pointer to member of \tcode{D} of type \cv{} \tcode{T}'',
indirection through it with a \tcode{D} object is valid. The result is the same

\tcode{B} subobject of \tcode{D}. The null member pointer value is
converted to the null member pointer value of the destination
type.
\begin{footnote}
The rule for conversion of pointers to members (from pointer to member
of base to pointer to member of derived) appears inverted compared to
the rule for pointers to objects (from pointer to derived to pointer to

conversion rank shall be converted to the type of the operand with
greater rank.

\item Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank
greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, the
operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the
operand with unsigned integer type.

\item Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can
represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned
integer type, the operand with unsigned integer type shall be converted

An \grammarterm{id-expression} that denotes a non-static data member or
non-static member function of a class can only be used:
\begin{itemize}
\item as part of a class member access\iref{expr.ref} in which the
object expression
refers to the member's class
\begin{footnote}
This also applies when the object expression
is an implicit \tcode{(*\keyword{this})}~(\ref{class.mfct.non-static}).
\end{footnote}
or a class derived from
that class, or

\item to form a pointer to member\iref{expr.unary.op}, or

\item if that \grammarterm{id-expression} denotes a non-static data member
and it appears in an unevaluated operand.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  int m;
};
int i = sizeof(S::m);           // OK
int j = sizeof(S::m + 42);      // OK

For an \grammarterm{id-expression} that denotes an overload set,
overload resolution is performed
to select a unique function~(\ref{over.match}, \ref{over.over}).
\begin{note}
A program cannot refer to a function
with a trailing \grammarterm{requires-clause}
whose \grammarterm{constraint-expression} is not satisfied,
because such functions are never selected by overload resolution.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T> struct A {
  static void f(int) requires false;
}

void g() {
  A<int>::f(0);                         // error: cannot call \tcode{f}
  void (*p1)(int) = A<int>::f;          // error: cannot take the address of \tcode{f}
  decltype(A<int>::f)* p2 = nullptr;    // error: the type \tcode{decltype(A<int>::f)} is invalid
}
\end{codeblock}
In each case, the constraints of \tcode{f} are not satisfied.
In the declaration of \tcode{p2},
those constraints are required to be satisfied
even though
\tcode{f} is an unevaluated operand\iref{expr.prop}.

The closure type for a non-generic \grammarterm{lambda-expression} with no
\grammarterm{lambda-capture}
whose constraints (if any) are satisfied
has a conversion function to pointer to
function with \Cpp{} language linkage\iref{dcl.link} having
the same parameter and return types as the closure type's function call operator.
The conversion is to ``pointer to \keyword{noexcept} function''
if the function call operator
has a non-throwing exception specification.
The value returned by this conversion function
is the address of a function \tcode{F} that, when invoked,
has the same effect as invoking the closure type's function call operator
on a default-constructed instance of the closure type.
\tcode{F} is a constexpr function
if the function call operator is a constexpr function
and is an immediate function
if the function call operator is an immediate function.

\pnum
For a generic lambda with no \grammarterm{lambda-capture}, the closure type has a
conversion function template to
pointer to function. The conversion function template has the same invented
template parameter list, and the pointer to function has the same
parameter types, as the function call operator template.  The return type of
the pointer to function shall behave as if it were a
\grammarterm{decltype-specifier} denoting the return type of the corresponding
function call operator template specialization.

\pnum
\begin{note}
If the generic lambda has no \grammarterm{trailing-return-type} or
the \grammarterm{trailing-return-type} contains a placeholder type, return type
deduction of the corresponding function call operator template specialization
has to be done. The corresponding specialization is that instantiation of the
function call operator template with the same template arguments as those
deduced for the conversion function template.  Consider the following:
\begin{codeblock}
auto glambda = [](auto a) { return a; };
int (*fp)(int) = glambda;
\end{codeblock}
The behavior of the conversion function of \tcode{glambda} above is like
that of the following conversion function:
\begin{codeblock}
struct Closure {
  template<class T> auto operator()(T t) const { @\commentellip@ }
  template<class T> static auto lambda_call_operator_invoker(T a) {
    // forwards execution to \tcode{operator()(a)} and therefore has
    // the same return type deduced
    @\commentellip@
  }
  template<class T> using fptr_t =
     decltype(lambda_call_operator_invoker(declval<T>())) (*)(T);

  template<class T> operator fptr_t<T>() const
    { return &lambda_call_operator_invoker; }

The value returned by any given specialization of this conversion function
template is the address of a function \tcode{F} that, when invoked, has the same
effect as invoking the generic lambda's corresponding function call operator
template specialization on a default-constructed instance of the closure type.
\tcode{F} is a constexpr function
if the corresponding specialization is a constexpr function and
\tcode{F} is an immediate function
if the function call operator template specialization is an immediate function.
\begin{note}
This will result in the implicit instantiation of the generic lambda's body.
The instantiated generic lambda's return type and parameter types are required to match
the return type and parameter types of the pointer to function.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
auto GL = [](auto a) { std::cout << a; return a; };
int (*GL_int)(int) = GL;        // OK: through conversion function template
GL_int(3);                      // OK: same as \tcode{GL(3)}

The conversion function or conversion function template is public,
constexpr, non-virtual, non-explicit, const, and has a non-throwing exception
specification\iref{except.spec}.

auto C = [](auto a) { return a; };

static_assert(Fwd(C,3) == 3);   // OK

// No specialization of the function call operator template can be constexpr (due to the local static).
auto NC = [](auto a) { static int s; return a; };
static_assert(Fwd(NC,3) == 3);  // error

The \grammarterm{lambda-expression}'s \grammarterm{compound-statement} yields
the \grammarterm{function-body}\iref{dcl.fct.def} of the function call operator,

\begin{codeblock}
struct S1 {

  void f() {
    [=]()->int {
      return operator()(this->x + y);   // equivalent to \tcode{S1::operator()(this->x + (*this).y)}

  }
};
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

the \grammarterm{compound-statement} of the \grammarterm{lambda-expression},

\pnum
The closure type associated with a \grammarterm{lambda-expression} has no

The body of a \grammarterm{lambda-expression} may refer to local entities
of enclosing block scopes by capturing those entities, as described
below.

\pnum
If a \grammarterm{lambda-capture} includes a \grammarterm{capture-default} that
is \tcode{\&}, no identifier in a \grammarterm{simple-capture} of that
\grammarterm{lambda-capture} shall be preceded
by \tcode{\&}. If a \grammarterm{lambda-capture} includes a
\grammarterm{capture-default} that is \tcode{=}, each
\grammarterm{simple-capture} of that \grammarterm{lambda-capture} shall
be of the form
``\tcode{\&} \grammarterm{identifier} \opt{\tcode{...}}'',
``\keyword{this}'',
or ``\tcode{* \keyword{this}}''.
\begin{note}
The form \tcode{[\&,\keyword{this}]} is redundant but accepted
for compatibility with ISO \CppXIV{}.
\end{note}
Ignoring appearances in
\grammarterm{initializer}{s} of \grammarterm{init-capture}{s}, an identifier or
\keyword{this} shall not appear more than once in a
\grammarterm{lambda-capture}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S2 { void f(int i); };
void S2::f(int i) {
  [&, i]{ };        // OK
  [&, this, i]{ };  // OK, equivalent to \tcode{[\&, i]}
  [&, &i]{ };       // error: \tcode{i} preceded by \tcode{\&} when \tcode{\&} is the default
  [=, *this]{ };    // OK
  [=, this]{ };     // OK, equivalent to \tcode{[=]}
  [i, i]{ };        // error: \tcode{i} repeated
  [this, *this]{ }; // error: \keyword{this} appears twice
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
A \grammarterm{lambda-expression} shall not have
a \grammarterm{capture-default} or \grammarterm{simple-capture}
in its \grammarterm{lambda-introducer}
unless its innermost enclosing scope is a block scope\iref{basic.scope.block}
or it appears within a default member initializer
and its innermost enclosing scope is
the corresponding class scope\iref{basic.scope.class}.

\pnum
The \grammarterm{identifier} in a \grammarterm{simple-capture}
shall denote a local entity (\ref{basic.lookup.unqual}, \ref{basic.pre}).
The \grammarterm{simple-capture}{s} \keyword{this} and \tcode{* \keyword{this}}
denote the local entity \tcode{*\keyword{this}}.
An entity that is designated by a
\grammarterm{simple-capture}
is said to be \defn{explicitly captured}.

\pnum
If an \grammarterm{identifier} in a \grammarterm{simple-capture} appears
as the \grammarterm{declarator-id} of a parameter of
the \grammarterm{lambda-declarator}{'s} \grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause},
the program is ill-formed.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void f() {
  int x = 0;
  auto g = [x](int x) { return 0; };    // error: parameter and \grammarterm{simple-capture} have the same name
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
An \grammarterm{init-capture} inhabits the scope of
the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}'s \grammarterm{compound-statement}.
An \grammarterm{init-capture} without ellipsis
behaves as if it declares and explicitly captures a variable of
the form ``\keyword{auto} \grammarterm{init-capture} \tcode{;}'', except that:
\begin{itemize}
\item if the capture is by copy (see below), the non-static data member
declared for the capture and the variable are treated as two different ways
of referring to the same object, which has the lifetime of the non-static
data member, and no additional copy and destruction is performed, and
\item if the capture is by reference, the variable's lifetime ends when the
closure object's lifetime ends.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
This enables an \grammarterm{init-capture} like
``\tcode{x = std::move(x)}''; the second ``\tcode{x}'' must bind to a
declaration in the surrounding context.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
int x = 4;
auto y = [&r = x, x = x+1]()->int {
            r += 2;
            return x+2;
         }();                               // Updates \tcode{::x} to 6, and initializes \tcode{y} to 7.

auto z = [a = 42](int a) { return 1; };     // error: parameter and local variable have the same name
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
For the purposes of lambda capture,
an expression potentially references local entities as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
An \grammarterm{id-expression} that names a local entity
potentially references that entity;
an \grammarterm{id-expression} that names
one or more non-static class members
and does not form a pointer to member\iref{expr.unary.op}
potentially references \tcode{*\keyword{this}}.
\begin{note}
This occurs even if overload resolution
selects a static member function for the \grammarterm{id-expression}.
\end{note}

\item
A \keyword{this} expression potentially references \tcode{*\keyword{this}}.

\item
A \grammarterm{lambda-expression} potentially references
the local entities named by its \grammarterm{simple-capture}{s}.
\end{itemize}

If an expression potentially references a local entity
within a scope in which it is odr-usable,
and the expression would be potentially evaluated
if the effect of any enclosing \keyword{typeid} expressions\iref{expr.typeid} were ignored,
the entity is said to be \defnx{implicitly captured}{capture!implicit}
by each intervening \grammarterm{lambda-expression} with an associated
\grammarterm{capture-default} that does not explicitly capture it.
The implicit capture of \tcode{*\keyword{this}} is deprecated when the
\grammarterm{capture-default} is \tcode{=}; see \ref{depr.capture.this}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void f(int, const int (&)[2] = {});         // \#1
void f(const int&, const int (&)[1]);       // \#2
void test() {
  const int x = 17;
  auto g = [](auto a) {
    f(x);                       // OK: calls \#1, does not capture \tcode{x}
  };

  auto g1 = [=](auto a) {
    f(x);                       // OK: calls \#1, captures \tcode{x}
  };

  auto g2 = [=](auto a) {
    int selector[sizeof(a) == 1 ? 1 : 2]{};
    f(x, selector);             // OK: captures \tcode{x}, can call \#1 or \#2
  };

  auto g3 = [=](auto a) {
    typeid(a + x);              // captures \tcode{x} regardless of whether \tcode{a + x} is an unevaluated operand
  };
}
\end{codeblock}
Within \tcode{g1}, an implementation can optimize away
the capture of \tcode{x} as it is not odr-used.
\end{example}
\begin{note}
The set of captured entities is determined syntactically,
and entities are implicitly captured
even if the expression denoting a local entity
is within a discarded statement\iref{stmt.if}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<bool B>
void f(int n) {
  [=](auto a) {
    if constexpr (B && sizeof(a) > 4) {
      (void)n;                  // captures \tcode{n} regardless of the value of \tcode{B} and \tcode{sizeof(int)}
    }
  }(0);
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{note}

\pnum
An entity is \defn{captured} if it is captured explicitly or implicitly. An entity
captured by a \grammarterm{lambda-expression} is odr-used\iref{basic.def.odr} by
the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}.
\begin{note}
As a consequence, if a \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
explicitly captures an entity that is not odr-usable,
the program is ill-formed\iref{basic.def.odr}.

\pnum
\begin{note}
Because local entities are not
odr-usable within a default argument\iref{basic.def.odr},
a \grammarterm{lambda-expression} appearing in a default argument
cannot implicitly or explicitly capture any local entity.
Such a \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
can still have an \grammarterm{init-capture} if
any full-expression in its \grammarterm{initializer}
satisfies the constraints of an expression appearing in
a default argument\iref{dcl.fct.default}.
\end{note}

An entity is \defnx{captured by copy}{captured!by copy} if
\begin{itemize}
\item
it is implicitly captured,
the \grammarterm{capture-default} is \tcode{=}, and
the captured entity is not \tcode{*\keyword{this}}, or
\item
it is explicitly captured with a capture that is not of the form
\keyword{this},
\tcode{\&} \grammarterm{identifier}, or
\tcode{\&} \grammarterm{identifier} \grammarterm{initializer}.
\end{itemize}
For each entity captured by copy, an
unnamed non-static data member is declared in the closure type. The declaration order of
these members is unspecified. The type of such a data member is
the referenced type if the entity is a reference to an object,
an lvalue reference to the referenced function type if the entity is a reference to a function, or
the type of the corresponding captured entity otherwise.
A member of an anonymous union shall not be captured by copy.

\pnum
Every \grammarterm{id-expression} within the \grammarterm{compound-statement} of a
\grammarterm{lambda-expression} that is an odr-use\iref{basic.def.odr} of an
entity captured by copy is transformed into an access to the corresponding unnamed data
member of the closure type.
\begin{note}
An \grammarterm{id-expression} that is not an odr-use refers to
the original entity, never to a member of the closure type.
However, such
an \grammarterm{id-expression} can still cause the implicit capture of the
entity.
\end{note}
If \tcode{*\keyword{this}} is captured by copy, each expression that odr-uses \tcode{*\keyword{this}} is
transformed to instead refer to the corresponding unnamed data member of the closure type.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void f(const int*);
void g() {
  const int N = 10;
  [=] {
    int arr[N];     // OK: not an odr-use, refers to automatic variable
    f(&N);          // OK: causes \tcode{N} to be captured; \tcode{\&N} points to
                    // the corresponding member of the closure type
  };
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
An entity is \defnx{captured by reference}{captured!by reference} if it is implicitly or explicitly
captured but not captured by copy. It is unspecified whether additional unnamed
non-static data members are declared in the closure type for entities captured by
reference.
If declared, such non-static data members shall be of literal type.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
// The inner closure type must be a literal type regardless of how reference captures are represented.
static_assert([](int n) { return [&n] { return ++n; }(); }(3) == 4);
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
A bit-field or a member of an anonymous union
shall not be captured by reference.

\pnum
An \grammarterm{id-expression} within
the \grammarterm{compound-statement} of a \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
that is an odr-use of a reference captured by reference
refers to the entity to which the captured reference is bound and
not to the captured reference.
\begin{note}
The validity of such captures is determined by
the lifetime of the object to which the reference refers,
not by the lifetime of the reference itself.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
auto h(int &r) {
  return [&] {
    ++r;            // Valid after \tcode{h} returns if the lifetime of the
                    // object to which \tcode{r} is bound has not ended
  };
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
If a \grammarterm{lambda-expression} \tcode{m2} captures an entity and that entity is
captured by an immediately enclosing \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
\tcode{m1}, then
\tcode{m2}'s capture is transformed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item if \tcode{m1} captures the entity by copy,
\tcode{m2} captures the corresponding
non-static data member of \tcode{m1}'s closure type;
\item if \tcode{m1} captures the entity by reference,
\tcode{m2} captures the same
entity captured by \tcode{m1}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
The nested \grammarterm{lambda-expression}s and invocations below will output
\tcode{123234}.
\begin{codeblock}
int a = 1, b = 1, c = 1;
auto m1 = [a, &b, &c]() mutable {
  auto m2 = [a, b, &c]() mutable {
    std::cout << a << b << c;
    a = 4; b = 4; c = 4;
  };
  a = 3; b = 3; c = 3;
  m2();
};
a = 2; b = 2; c = 2;
m1();
std::cout << a << b << c;
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
When the \grammarterm{lambda-expression} is evaluated, the entities that are
captured by copy are used to direct-initialize each corresponding non-static data member
of the resulting closure object, and the non-static data members corresponding to the
\grammarterm{init-capture}{s} are initialized as indicated by the corresponding
\grammarterm{initializer} (which may be copy- or direct-initialization). (For array members, the array elements are
direct-initialized in increasing subscript order.) These initializations are performed
in the (unspecified) order in which the non-static data members are declared.
\begin{note}
This ensures that the destructions will occur in the reverse order of the constructions.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
If a non-reference entity is implicitly or explicitly captured by reference,
invoking the function call operator of the corresponding \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
after the lifetime of the entity has ended is likely to result in undefined behavior.

\pnum
A \grammarterm{requires-expression} provides a concise way to express
requirements on template arguments
that can be checked by name lookup\iref{basic.lookup}
or by checking properties of types and expressions.

\pnum
A \grammarterm{requires-expression} is a prvalue of type \tcode{bool}
whose value is described below.
Expressions appearing within a \grammarterm{requirement-body}
are unevaluated operands\iref{expr.prop}.

\pnum
\begin{example}
A common use of \grammarterm{requires-expression}s is to define
requirements in concepts such as the one below:
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T>
  concept R = requires (T i) {
    typename T::type;
    {*i} -> std::@\libconcept{convertible_to}@<const typename T::type&>;
  };
\end{codeblock}
A \grammarterm{requires-expression} can also be used in a
\grammarterm{requires-clause}\iref{temp.pre} as a way of writing ad hoc
constraints on template arguments such as the one below:
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T>
  requires requires (T x) { x + x; }
    T add(T a, T b) { return a + b; }
\end{codeblock}
The first \keyword{requires} introduces the
\grammarterm{requires-clause}, and the second
introduces the \grammarterm{requires-expression}.
\end{example}

\pnum
A \grammarterm{requires-expression} may introduce local parameters using a
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause}\iref{dcl.fct}.
A local parameter of a \grammarterm{requires-expression} shall not have a
default argument.
These parameters have no linkage, storage, or lifetime; they are only used
as notation for the purpose of defining \grammarterm{requirement}s.
The \grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} of a
\grammarterm{requirement-parameter-list}
shall not terminate with an ellipsis.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T>
concept C = requires(T t, ...) {    // error: terminates with an ellipsis
  t;
};
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
The substitution of template arguments into a \grammarterm{requires-expression}
may result in the formation of invalid types or expressions in its
\grammarterm{requirement}s or the violation of the semantic constraints of those \grammarterm{requirement}s.
In such cases, the \grammarterm{requires-expression} evaluates to \keyword{false};
it does not cause the program to be ill-formed.
The substitution and semantic constraint checking
proceeds in lexical order and stops when a condition that
determines the result of the \grammarterm{requires-expression} is encountered.
If substitution (if any) and semantic constraint checking succeed,
the \grammarterm{requires-expression} evaluates to \keyword{true}.
\begin{note}
If a \grammarterm{requires-expression} contains invalid types or expressions in
its \grammarterm{requirement}s, and it does not appear within the declaration of a templated
entity, then the program is ill-formed.
\end{note}
If the substitution of template arguments into a \grammarterm{requirement}
would always result in a substitution failure, the program is ill-formed;
no diagnostic required.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T> concept C =
requires {
  new int[-(int)sizeof(T)];     // ill-formed, no diagnostic required
};
\end{codeblock}

A \grammarterm{simple-requirement} asserts
the validity of an \grammarterm{expression}.
\begin{note}
The enclosing \grammarterm{requires-expression} will evaluate to \keyword{false}
if substitution of template arguments into the \grammarterm{expression} fails.
The \grammarterm{expression} is an unevaluated operand\iref{expr.prop}.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T> concept C =
  requires (T a, T b) {
    a + b;          // \tcode{C<T>} is \tcode{true} if \tcode{a + b} is a valid expression
  };

\end{example}

\pnum
A \grammarterm{requirement} that starts with a \keyword{requires} token

\pnum
A \grammarterm{compound-requirement} asserts properties
of the \grammarterm{expression} $E$. Substitution
of template arguments (if any) and verification of
semantic properties proceed in the following order:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Substitution of template arguments (if any)
into the \grammarterm{expression} is performed.

\item
If the \keyword{noexcept} specifier is present,
$E$ shall not be a potentially-throwing expression\iref{except.spec}.

\item
If the \grammarterm{return-type-requirement} is present, then:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Substitution of template arguments (if any)
into the \grammarterm{return-type-requirement} is performed.

\item
The immediately-declared constraint\iref{temp.param}
of the \grammarterm{type-constraint} for \tcode{\keyword{decltype}((E))}
shall be satisfied.
\begin{example}
Given concepts \tcode{C} and \tcode{D},
\begin{codeblock}
requires {
  { E1 } -> C;
  { E2 } -> @D<A$_1$, $\cdots$, A$_n$>@;
};
\end{codeblock}
is equivalent to
\begin{codeblock}
requires {
  E1; requires C<decltype((E1))>;
  E2; requires @D<decltype((E2)), A$_1$, $\cdots$, A$_n$>@;
};
\end{codeblock}
(including in the case where $n$ is zero).
\end{example}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T> concept C1 = requires(T x) {
  {x++};
};
\end{codeblock}
The \grammarterm{compound-requirement} in \tcode{C1}
requires that \tcode{x++} is a valid expression.
It is equivalent to the \grammarterm{simple-requirement}
\tcode{x++;}.

\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T> concept C2 = requires(T x) {
  {*x} -> std::@\libconcept{same_as}@<typename T::inner>;
};
\end{codeblock}

The \grammarterm{compound-requirement} in \tcode{C2}
requires that \tcode{*x} is a valid expression,
that \tcode{typename T::inner} is a valid type, and
that \tcode{std::\libconcept{same_as}<decltype((*x)), typename T::inner>} is satisfied.

\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T> concept C3 =
  requires(T x) {
    {g(x)} noexcept;
  };
\end{codeblock}

The \grammarterm{compound-requirement} in \tcode{C3}
requires that \tcode{g(x)} is a valid expression and
that \tcode{g(x)} is non-throwing.

A \grammarterm{nested-requirement} can be used
to specify additional constraints in terms of local parameters.
The \grammarterm{constraint-expression}
shall be satisfied\iref{temp.constr.decl}
by the substituted template arguments, if any.
Substitution of template arguments into a \grammarterm{nested-requirement}
does not result in substitution into the \grammarterm{constraint-expression}
other than as specified in \ref{temp.constr.constr}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename U> concept C = sizeof(U) == 1;

A function call is a postfix expression followed by parentheses
containing a possibly empty, comma-separated list of
\grammarterm{initializer-clause}{s} which
constitute the arguments to the function.
\begin{note}
If the postfix expression is a function or member function name,
the appropriate function and the validity of the call
are determined according to the rules in~\ref{over.match}.
\end{note}
The postfix expression shall
have function type or function pointer type.
For a call to a non-member function or to a static member function,
the postfix expression shall either be an lvalue that refers to a
function (in which case the function-to-pointer standard
conversion\iref{conv.func} is suppressed on the postfix expression),
or have function pointer type.

\pnum
For a call to a non-static member function,
the postfix expression shall be an
implicit~(\ref{class.mfct.non-static}, \ref{class.static}) or explicit
class member access\iref{expr.ref} whose \grammarterm{id-expression} is a
function member name, or a pointer-to-member
expression\iref{expr.mptr.oper} selecting a function member; the call is as a member of
the class object referred to by the
object expression. In the case of an implicit class
member access, the implied object is the one pointed to by \keyword{this}.
\begin{note}
A member function call of the form \tcode{f()} is interpreted as
\tcode{(*\keyword{this}).f()} (see~\ref{class.mfct.non-static}).
\end{note}

\pnum
If the selected
function is non-virtual, or if the \grammarterm{id-expression} in the class
member access expression is a \grammarterm{qualified-id}, that function is
called. Otherwise, its final overrider\iref{class.virtual} in the dynamic type
of the object expression is called; such a call is referred to as a
\defnx{virtual function call}{function!virtual function call}.
\begin{note}
The dynamic type is the type of the object referred to by the
current value of the object expression. \ref{class.cdtor}~describes the
behavior of virtual function calls when the object expression
refers to
an object under construction or destruction.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
If a function or member function name is used, and name
lookup\iref{basic.lookup} does not find a declaration of that name,
the program is ill-formed. No function is implicitly declared by such a
call.
\end{note}

\pnum
If the \grammarterm{postfix-expression} names
a destructor or pseudo-destructor\iref{expr.prim.id.dtor},
the type of the function call expression is \keyword{void}; otherwise, the
type of the function call expression is the return type of the
statically chosen function (i.e., ignoring the \keyword{virtual} keyword),
even if the type of the function actually called is different.
\indextext{type!incomplete}%
If the \grammarterm{postfix-expression} names a pseudo-destructor
(in which case the \grammarterm{postfix-expression}
is a possibly-parenthesized class member access),
the function call destroys
the object of scalar type
denoted by the object expression
of the class member access (\ref{expr.ref}, \ref{basic.life}).

\pnum
Calling a function through an
expression whose function type is different
from the function type of the called function's
definition results in undefined behavior.

\pnum
\indextext{function argument|see{argument}}%

\indextext{initialization!parameter}%
When a function is called, each parameter\iref{dcl.fct} is
initialized~(\ref{dcl.init}, \ref{class.copy.ctor}) with
its corresponding argument.
If there is no corresponding argument,
the default argument for the parameter is used.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename ...T> int f(int n = 0, T ...t);
int x = f<int>();               // error: no argument for second function parameter
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
If the function is a non-static member
function, the \keyword{this} parameter of the function\iref{expr.prim.this}
is initialized with a pointer to the object of the call, converted
as if by an explicit type conversion\iref{expr.cast}.
\begin{note}
There is no access or ambiguity checking on this conversion; the access
checking and disambiguation are done as part of the (possibly implicit)
class member access operator.
See~\ref{class.member.lookup}, \ref{class.access.base},
and~\ref{expr.ref}.
\end{note}
When a function is called, the type of any parameter
shall not be a class type that is either incomplete or abstract.
\begin{note}
This still allows a parameter to be a pointer or reference to such
a type. However, it prevents a passed-by-value parameter
to have an incomplete or abstract class type.
\end{note}
It is \impldef{whether the lifetime of a parameter ends when the callee
returns or at the end of the enclosing full-expression} whether the
lifetime of a parameter ends when the function in which it is defined
returns or at the end of the enclosing full-expression.
The initialization and destruction of each parameter occurs
within the context of the calling function.
\begin{example}
The access of the constructor, conversion functions or destructor is
checked at the point of call in the calling function. If a constructor
or destructor for a function parameter throws an exception, the search
for a handler starts in the calling function; in
particular, if the function called has a \grammarterm{function-try-block}\iref{except.pre}
with a handler that can handle the exception,
this handler is not considered.

The \grammarterm{postfix-expression} is sequenced before
each \grammarterm{expression} in the \grammarterm{expression-list}
and any default argument.
The initialization of a parameter,
including every associated value computation and side effect,
is indeterminately sequenced with respect to that of any other parameter.
\begin{note}
All side effects of
argument evaluations are sequenced before the function is
entered (see~\ref{intro.execution}).
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void f() {
  std::string s = "but I have heard it works even if you don't believe in it";
  s.replace(0, 4, "").replace(s.find("even"), 4, "only").replace(s.find(" don't"), 6, "");
  assert(s == "I have heard it works only if you believe in it");       // OK
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
If an operator function is invoked
using operator notation,
argument evaluation is sequenced
as specified for the built-in operator;
see~\ref{over.match.oper}.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  S(int);
};
int operator<<(S, int);
int i, j;
int x = S(i=1) << (i=2);
int y = operator<<(S(j=1), j=2);
\end{codeblock}
After performing the initializations,
the value of \tcode{i} is 2 (see~\ref{expr.shift}),
but it is unspecified whether the value of \tcode{j} is 1 or 2.
\end{example}

\pnum
The result of a function call is the result of the possibly-converted operand
of the \keyword{return} statement\iref{stmt.return}
that transferred control out of the called function (if any),
except in a virtual function call if the return type of the
final overrider is different from the return type of the statically
chosen function, the value returned from the final overrider is
converted to the return type of the statically chosen function.

A function can change the values of its non-const parameters, but these

parameter is of a reference type\iref{dcl.ref}; if the reference is to
a const-qualified type, \keyword{const_cast} is required to be used to
cast away the constness in order to modify the argument's value. Where a
parameter is of \keyword{const} reference type a temporary object is
introduced if
needed~(\ref{dcl.type}, \ref{lex.literal}, \ref{lex.string}, \ref{dcl.array}, \ref{class.temporary}).
In addition, it is possible to modify the values of non-constant objects through
pointer parameters.

A function can be declared to accept fewer arguments (by declaring default

\tcode{...}, or a function parameter pack\iref{dcl.fct}) than the number of
parameters in the function definition\iref{dcl.fct.def}.
\begin{note}
This implies that, except where the ellipsis (\tcode{...}) or a function
parameter pack is used, a parameter is available for each argument.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{ellipsis!conversion sequence}%
When there is no parameter for a given argument, the argument is passed
in such a way that the receiving function can obtain the value of the
argument by invoking \tcode{va_arg}\iref{support.runtime}.
\begin{note}
This paragraph does not apply to arguments passed to a function parameter pack.
Function parameter packs are expanded during template instantiation\iref{temp.variadic},
thus each such argument has a corresponding parameter when a function template
specialization is actually called.
\end{note}
The
lvalue-to-rvalue\iref{conv.lval}, array-to-pointer\iref{conv.array},
and function-to-pointer\iref{conv.func} standard conversions are
performed on the argument expression.
An argument that has type \cv{}~\tcode{std::nullptr_t} is converted
to type \tcode{\keyword{void}*}\iref{conv.ptr}.
After these conversions, if the
argument does not have arithmetic, enumeration, pointer, pointer-to-member,
or class type, the program is ill-formed. Passing a potentially-evaluated
argument
of a scoped enumeration type or
of a class type\iref{class} having an eligible non-trivial
copy constructor, an eligible non-trivial move constructor,
or a
non-trivial destructor\iref{special},
with no corresponding parameter, is conditionally-supported with
\impldef{passing argument of class type through ellipsis} semantics. If the argument has
integral or enumeration type that is subject to the integral
promotions\iref{conv.prom}, or a floating-point type that is subject to the
floating-point promotion\iref{conv.fpprom}, the value of the argument is converted to the
promoted type before the call. These promotions are referred to as
the \defnx{default argument promotions}{promotion!default argument promotion}.

If \tcode{E2} is declared to have type ``reference to \tcode{T}'', then
\tcode{E1.E2} is an lvalue; the type of \tcode{E1.E2} is \tcode{T}.
Otherwise, one of the following rules applies.

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{E2} is a static data member and the type of \tcode{E2}
is \tcode{T}, then \tcode{E1.E2} is an lvalue; the expression designates
the named member of the class. The type of \tcode{E1.E2} is \tcode{T}.

The type of \tcode{E1.E2} is the type of \tcode{E2}

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{E2} refers to a static member function,
\tcode{E1.E2} is an lvalue.

\item Otherwise (when \tcode{E2} refers to a non-static member function),
\tcode{E1.E2} is a prvalue. The expression can be used only as the
left-hand operand of a member function call\iref{class.mfct}.

Any redundant set of parentheses surrounding the expression
is ignored\iref{expr.prim.paren}.

ill-formed.

\item If \tcode{E2} is a member enumerator and the type of \tcode{E2}
is \tcode{T}, the expression \tcode{E1.E2} is a prvalue. The type of
\tcode{E1.E2} is \tcode{T}.

If \tcode{E2} is a non-static data member or a non-static member
function, the program is ill-formed if the class of which \tcode{E2} is

Therefore, a function call cannot intervene between the
lvalue-to-rvalue conversion and the side effect associated with any
single postfix \tcode{++} operator.

If the original pointer value represents the address
\tcode{A} of a byte in memory and
\tcode{A} does not satisfy the alignment requirement of \tcode{T},

The ambiguity is resolved by treating \tcode{\~{}} as the unary complement

\begin{note}
Because the grammar does not permit an operator to follow the

Here, each instance of \tcode{x} is a non-negative unspecified value
representing array allocation overhead; the result of the
\grammarterm{new-expression} will be offset by this amount from the value
returned by \tcode{operator new[]}. This overhead may be applied in all
array \grammarterm{new-expression}{s}, including those referencing
a placement allocation function, except when referencing
the library function \tcode{operator new[](std::size_t, void*)}.
The amount of overhead may vary from one
invocation of \keyword{new} to another.

propagating the exception does not cause the object's memory to be

ill-formed. For a non-placement allocation function, the normal deallocation
function lookup is used to find the matching deallocation
function\iref{expr.delete}.

called, it is passed the same additional arguments as were passed to the
placement allocation function, that is, the same arguments as those
specified with the \grammarterm{new-placement} syntax.
If the implementation is allowed
to introduce a temporary object or make a copy of any argument
as part of the call to the allocation function,
it is unspecified whether the same object is used in the call
to both the allocation and deallocation functions.

\end{note}
Attempts are made to form an implicit conversion sequence
from an operand expression \tcode{E1} of type \tcode{T1}
to a target type related to the type \tcode{T2}
of the operand expression \tcode{E2} as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{E2} is an lvalue, the target type is
``lvalue reference to \tcode{T2}'',
but an implicit conversion sequence can only be formed
if the reference would bind directly\iref{dcl.init.ref}
to a glvalue.

\item If \tcode{E2} is an xvalue, the target type is
``rvalue reference to \tcode{T2}'',
but an implicit conversion sequence can only be formed
if the reference would bind directly.

\item If \tcode{E2} is a prvalue or if neither of the conversion sequences above can be
formed and at least one of the operands has (possibly cv-qualified) class type:
\begin{itemize}
\item if \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2} are the same class type
(ignoring cv-qualification) and
\tcode{T2} is at least as cv-qualified as \tcode{T1},
the target type is \tcode{T2},

\item otherwise, if \tcode{T2} is a base class of \tcode{T1},
the target type is \cvqual{cv1} \tcode{T2}, where \cvqual{cv1}
denotes the cv-qualifiers of \tcode{T1},

\item otherwise, the target type is the type that \tcode{E2} would have
after applying the
lvalue-to-rvalue\iref{conv.lval},
array-to-pointer\iref{conv.array}, and
function-to-pointer\iref{conv.func}
standard conversions.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Using this process, it is determined whether an implicit conversion
sequence can be formed from the second operand
to the target type determined for the third operand, and vice versa.
If both sequences can be formed, or one can be formed but it is the
ambiguous conversion sequence, the program is ill-formed.
If no conversion sequence can be formed, the operands are left unchanged
and further checking is performed as described below.
Otherwise, if exactly one conversion sequence can be formed,
that conversion is applied to the chosen operand
and the converted operand is used in place of the original operand for
the remainder of this subclause.
\begin{note}
The conversion might be ill-formed even if an implicit conversion
sequence could be formed.
\end{note}

\pnum
If the second and third operands are glvalues of the same value category
and have the same type, the
result is of that type and value category and it is a bit-field if the
second or the third operand is a bit-field, or if both are bit-fields.

\pnum
Otherwise, the result is a prvalue. If the second and third operands do
not have the same type, and either has (possibly cv-qualified) class
type, overload resolution is used to determine the conversions (if any)
to be applied to the operands~(\ref{over.match.oper}, \ref{over.built}).
If the overload resolution fails, the program is ill-formed. Otherwise,
the conversions thus determined are applied, and the converted operands
are used in place of the original operands for the remainder of this
subclause.

\pnum
Lvalue-to-rvalue\iref{conv.lval}, array-to-pointer\iref{conv.array},
and function-to-pointer\iref{conv.func} standard conversions are
performed on the second and third operands. After those conversions, one
of the following shall hold:

\begin{itemize}
\item The second and third operands have the same type; the result is of
that type and the result object is initialized using the selected operand.

\item The second and third operands have arithmetic or enumeration type;
the usual arithmetic conversions\iref{expr.arith.conv} are performed to bring them to a common
type, and the result is of that type.

\item One or both of the second and third operands have pointer type;
pointer conversions\iref{conv.ptr},
function pointer conversions\iref{conv.fctptr}, and
qualification conversions\iref{conv.qual}
are performed to bring them to their
composite pointer type\iref{expr.type}. The result is of the composite
pointer type.

\item One or both of the second and third operands have pointer-to-member type;
pointer to member conversions\iref{conv.mem},
function pointer conversions\iref{conv.fctptr}, and
qualification conversions\iref{conv.qual}
are performed to bring them to their composite
pointer type\iref{expr.type}. The result is of the composite pointer type.

\item
Both the second and third operands have type \tcode{std::nullptr_t} or one has
that type and the other is a null pointer constant. The result is of type
\tcode{std::nullptr_t}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  it is not of class type nor (possibly multi-dimensional) array thereof, or
\item
  it is of class type or (possibly multi-dimensional) array thereof,
  that class type has a constexpr destructor, and
  for a hypothetical expression $E$
  whose only effect is to destroy \tcode{a},
  $E$ would be a core constant expression

An \defnadj{integral constant}{expression}
is an expression of integral or
unscoped enumeration type, implicitly converted to a prvalue, where the converted expression is a core constant expression.
\begin{note}
Such expressions can be
used as bit-field lengths\iref{class.bit}, as enumerator
initializers if the underlying type is not fixed\iref{dcl.enum},
and as alignments\iref{dcl.align}.
\end{note}

\pnum
If an expression of literal class type is used in a context where an
integral constant expression is required, then that expression is
contextually implicitly converted\iref{conv} to an integral or unscoped
enumeration type
and the selected conversion function shall be \keyword{constexpr}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A {
  constexpr A(int i) : val(i) { }
  constexpr operator int() const { return val; }
  constexpr operator long() const { return 42; }
private:
  int val;
};
constexpr A a = alignof(int);
alignas(a) int n;               // error: ambiguous conversion
struct B { int n : a; };        // error: ambiguous conversion
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
A \defnadj{converted constant}{expression}
of type \tcode{T} is an
expression, implicitly converted to type \tcode{T}, where
the converted expression is a constant expression and the
implicit conversion sequence contains only
\begin{itemize}
\item user-defined conversions,
\item lvalue-to-rvalue conversions\iref{conv.lval},
\item array-to-pointer conversions\iref{conv.array},
\item function-to-pointer conversions\iref{conv.func},
\item qualification conversions\iref{conv.qual},
\item integral promotions\iref{conv.prom},
\item integral conversions\iref{conv.integral} other than narrowing conversions\iref{dcl.init.list},
\item null pointer conversions\iref{conv.ptr} from \tcode{std::nullptr_t},
\item null member pointer conversions\iref{conv.mem} from \tcode{std::nullptr_t}, and
\item function pointer conversions\iref{conv.fctptr},
\end{itemize}
and where the reference binding (if any) binds directly.
\begin{note}
Such expressions can be used in \keyword{new}
expressions\iref{expr.new}, as case expressions\iref{stmt.switch},
as enumerator initializers if the underlying type is
fixed\iref{dcl.enum}, as array bounds\iref{dcl.array}, and

\pnum
A \defnadj{constant}{expression} is either
a glvalue core constant expression that refers to
an entity that is a permitted result of a constant expression (as defined below), or
a prvalue core constant expression whose value
satisfies the following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  if the value is an object of class type,
  each non-static data member of reference type refers to
  an entity that is a permitted result of a constant expression,
  \item
  if the value is of pointer type, it contains
  the address of an object with static storage duration,
  the address past the end of such an object\iref{expr.add},
  the address of a non-immediate function,
  or a null pointer value,

  \item
  if the value is of pointer-to-member-function type,
  it does not designate an immediate function, and

  \item
  if the value is an object of class or array type,
  each subobject satisfies these constraints for the value.
\end{itemize}
An entity is a
\defnx{permitted result of a constant expression}{constant expression!permitted result of}
if it is an
object with static storage duration that either is not a temporary object or is
a temporary object whose value satisfies the above constraints, or if
it is a non-immediate function.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
consteval int f() { return 42; }
consteval auto g() { return f; }
consteval int h(int (*p)() = g()) { return p(); }
constexpr int r = h();                          // OK
constexpr auto e = g();                         // error: a pointer to an immediate function is
                                                // not a permitted result of a constant expression
\end{codeblock}

Implementations should provide consistent results of floating-point evaluations,
irrespective of whether the evaluation is performed
during translation or during program execution.
\begin{note}
Since this document
imposes no restrictions on the accuracy of floating-point operations, it is unspecified whether the
evaluation of a floating-point expression during translation yields the same result as the
evaluation of the same expression (or the same operations on the same values) during program
execution.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
bool f() {
    char array[1 + int(1 + 0.2 - 0.1 - 0.1)];   // Must be evaluated during translation
    int size = 1 + int(1 + 0.2 - 0.1 - 0.1);    // May be evaluated at runtime
    return sizeof(array) == size;
}
\end{codeblock}
It is unspecified whether the value of \tcode{f()} will be \tcode{true} or \tcode{false}.
\end{example}

an immediate function and
is not in an immediate function context.
An immediate invocation shall be a constant expression.

that is usable in constant expressions or
has constant initialization\iref{basic.start.static}.

Testing this condition
can involve a trial evaluation of its initializer as described above.
