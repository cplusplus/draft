\enternote 
Clause~\ref{expr} defines the syntax, order of evaluation, and meaning
of expressions.\footnote{The precedence of operators is not directly specified, but it can be
derived from the syntax.}
An expression is a sequence of operators and operands that specifies a
computation. An expression can result in a value and can cause side
effects.
\exitnote 

\pnum
\indextext{operator!overloaded}%
\enternote 
Operators can be overloaded, that is, given meaning when applied to
expressions of class type~(Clause \ref{class}) or enumeration
type~(\ref{dcl.enum}). Uses of overloaded operators are transformed into
function calls as described in~\ref{over.oper}. Overloaded operators
obey the rules for syntax specified in Clause~\ref{expr}, but the
requirements of operand type, value category, and evaluation order are replaced
by the rules for function call. Relations between operators, such as
\tcode{++a} meaning \tcode{a+=1}, are not guaranteed for overloaded
operators~(\ref{over.oper}), and are not guaranteed for operands of type
\tcode{bool}.
\exitnote 

\pnum
Clause~\ref{expr} defines the effects of operators when applied to types
for which they have not been overloaded. Operator overloading shall not
modify the rules for the \term{built-in operators}, that
is, for operators applied to types for which they are defined by this
Standard. However, these built-in operators participate in overload
resolution, and as part of that process user-defined conversions will be
considered where necessary to convert the operands to types appropriate
for the built-in operator. If a built-in operator is selected, such
conversions will be applied to the operands before the operation is
considered further according to the rules in Clause~\ref{expr};
see~\ref{over.match.oper},~\ref{over.built}.

\pnum
\indextext{exception!arithmetic}%

\indextext{zero!remainder undefined}%
If during the evaluation of an expression, the result is not
mathematically defined or not in the range of representable values for
its type, the behavior is undefined.
\enternote 
\indextext{overflow}%
most existing implementations of \Cpp ignore integer overflows.
Treatment of division by zero, forming a remainder using a zero divisor,
and all floating point exceptions vary among machines, and is usually
adjustable by a library function.
\exitnote 

\pnum
\indextext{expression!reference}%
If an expression initially has the type ``reference to
\tcode{T}''~(\ref{dcl.ref},~\ref{dcl.init.ref}), the type is adjusted to
\tcode{T} prior to any further analysis. The expression designates the
object or function denoted by the reference, and the expression
is an lvalue or an xvalue, depending on the expression.

\pnum
If a prvalue initially has the type ``\cv{} \tcode{T},'' where
\tcode{T} is a cv-unqualified non-class, non-array type, the type of
the expression is adjusted to \tcode{T} prior to any further analysis.

\pnum
\indextext{expression!rvalue~reference}%
\enternote
An expression is an xvalue if it is:
\begin{itemize}
\item the result of calling a function, whether implicitly or explicitly,
whose return type is an rvalue reference to object type,

\item a cast to an rvalue reference to object type,

\item a class member access expression designating a non-static data member
of non-reference type
in which the object expression is an xvalue, or

\item a \tcode{.*} pointer-to-member expression in which the first operand is
an xvalue and the second operand is a pointer to data member.
\end{itemize}
In general, the effect of this rule is that named rvalue references are
treated as lvalues and unnamed rvalue references to objects are treated as
xvalues; rvalue references to functions are treated as lvalues whether named or not.
\exitnote

\enterexample
\begin{codeblock}
struct A {
  int m;
};
A&& operator+(A, A);
A&& f();

A a;
A&& ar = static_cast<A&&>(a);
\end{codeblock}

The expressions \tcode{f()}, \tcode{f().m}, \tcode{static_cast<A\&\&>(a)}, and \tcode{a + a}
are xvalues. The expression \tcode{ar} is an lvalue.

\pnum
In some contexts, \defnx{unevaluated operands}{unevaluated operand}
appear~(\ref{expr.typeid}, \ref{expr.sizeof}, \ref{expr.unary.noexcept}, \ref{dcl.type.simple}).
An unevaluated operand is not evaluated. An unevaluated operand is
considered a full-expression.
\enternote
In an unevaluated operand, a non-static class member may be
named~(\ref{expr.prim}) and naming of objects or functions does not, by
itself, require that a definition be provided~(\ref{basic.def.odr}).
\exitnote

\pnum
Whenever a glvalue expression appears as an operand of an operator that
expects a prvalue for that operand, the
lvalue-to-rvalue~(\ref{conv.lval}), array-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.array}),
or function-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.func}) standard conversions are
applied to convert the expression to a prvalue.
\enternote 
because cv-qualifiers are removed from the type of an expression of
non-class type when the expression is converted to a prvalue, an lvalue
expression of type \tcode{const int} can, for example, be used where
a prvalue expression of type \tcode{int} is required.
\exitnote 

\pnum
\indextext{conversion!usual arithmetic}%
Many binary operators that expect operands of arithmetic or enumeration
type cause conversions and yield result types in a similar way. The
purpose is to yield a common type, which is also the type of the result.
This pattern is called the \term{usual arithmetic conversions},
which are defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If either operand is of scoped enumeration type~(\ref{dcl.enum}), no conversions
are performed; if the other operand does not have the same type, the expression is
ill-formed.

\item If either operand is of type \tcode{long} \tcode{double}, the
other shall be converted to \tcode{long} \tcode{double}.

\item Otherwise, if either operand is \tcode{double}, the other shall be
converted to \tcode{double}.

\item Otherwise, if either operand is \tcode{float}, the other shall be
converted to \tcode{float}.

\item Otherwise, the integral promotions~(\ref{conv.prom}) shall be
performed on both operands.\footnote{As a consequence, operands of type \tcode{bool}, \tcode{char16_t},
\tcode{char32_t}, \tcode{wchar_t}, or an enumerated type are converted
to some integral type.}
Then the following rules shall be applied to the promoted operands:

\begin{itemize}

\item If both operands have the same type, no further conversion is
needed.

\item Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have
unsigned integer types, the operand with the type of lesser integer
conversion rank shall be converted to the type of the operand with
greater rank.

\item Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank
greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, the
operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the
operand with unsigned integer type.

\item Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can
represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned
integer type, the operand with unsigned integer type shall be converted
to the type of the operand with signed integer type.

\item Otherwise, both operands shall be converted to the unsigned
integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed
integer type.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\pnum
In some contexts, an expression only appears for its side effects. Such an
expression is called a \defn{discarded-value expression}. The expression is
evaluated and its value is discarded. The array-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.array})
and function-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.func}) standard conversions are not
applied. The lvalue-to-rvalue conversion~(\ref{conv.lval}) is applied
if and only if
the expression is a glvalue of volatile-qualified type and it is one of the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{(} \grammarterm{expression} \tcode{)}, where
  \grammarterm{expression} is one of these expressions,
\item \grammarterm{id-expression}~(\ref{expr.prim.general}),
\item subscripting~(\ref{expr.sub}),
\item class member access~(\ref{expr.ref}),
\item indirection~(\ref{expr.unary.op}),
\item pointer-to-member operation~(\ref{expr.mptr.oper}),
\item conditional expression~(\ref{expr.cond}) where both the second and the
      third operands are one of these expressions, or
\item comma expression~(\ref{expr.comma}) where the right operand is one of
      these expressions.
\end{itemize}

\enternote Using an overloaded operator causes a function call; the
above covers only operators with built-in meaning. If the lvalue is of
class type, it must have a volatile copy constructor to initialize the
temporary that is the result of the lvalue-to-rvalue
conversion. \exitnote

\pnum
The values of the floating operands and the results of floating
expressions may be represented in greater precision and range than that
required by the type; the types are not changed\
thereby.\footnote{The cast and assignment operators must still perform their specific
conversions as described in~\ref{expr.cast},~\ref{expr.static.cast}
and~\ref{expr.ass}.}

\pnum
The \term{cv-combined type} of two types \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2}
is a type \tcode{T3}
similar to \tcode{T1} whose cv-qualification signature~(\ref{conv.qual}) is:
\begin{itemize}
\item
for every $j > 0$, \cv$_{3,j}$ is the union of
\cv$_{1,j}$ and \cv$_{2,j}$;

\item
if the resulting \cv$_{3,j}$ is different from
\cv$_{1,j}$ or \cv$_{2,j}$, then
\tcode{const} is added to every \cv$_{3,k}$ for $0 < k < j$.
\end{itemize}

\enternote Given similar types \tcode{T1} and \tcode{T2}, this
construction ensures that
both can be converted to \tcode{T3}. \exitnote

otherwise, a program that necessitates the determination of a
composite pointer type is ill-formed.

The closure type for a non-generic \grammarterm{lambda-expression} has a public
inline function call operator~(\ref{over.call}) whose parameters and return type
are described by the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}'s
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} and \grammarterm{trailing-return-type}
respectively.
For a generic lambda, the closure type has a public inline function call
operator member template~(\ref{temp.mem}) whose
\grammarterm{template-parameter-list} consists of one invented type
\grammarterm{template-parameter} for each occurrence of \tcode{auto} in the
lambda's \grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause}, in order of appearance.
The invented type \grammarterm{template-parameter} is a parameter pack if
the corresponding \grammarterm{parameter-declaration} declares a function
parameter pack~(\ref{dcl.fct}). The return type and function parameters of the
function call operator template are derived from the
\grammarterm{lambda-expression}{'s} \grammarterm{trailing-return-type} and
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} by replacing each occurrence of
\tcode{auto} in the \grammarterm{decl-specifier}{s} of the
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} with the name of the corresponding
invented \grammarterm{template-parameter}.

The closure type for a non-generic \grammarterm{lambda-expression} with no
\grammarterm{lambda-capture}
has a public non-virtual non-explicit const conversion function to pointer to
function with \Cpp language linkage~(\ref{dcl.link}) having
the same parameter and return types as the closure type's function call operator. The
value returned by this conversion function shall be the address of a function that, when
invoked, has the same effect as invoking the closure type's function call operator.
For a generic lambda with no \grammarterm{lambda-capture}, the closure type has a
public non-virtual non-explicit const conversion function template to
pointer to function. The conversion function template has the same invented
\grammarterm{template-parameter-list}, and the pointer to function has the same
parameter types, as the function call operator template.  The return type of
the pointer to function shall behave as if it were a
\grammarterm{decltype-specifier} denoting the return type of the corresponding
function call operator template specialization.
\enternote If the generic lambda has no \grammarterm{trailing-return-type} or
the \grammarterm{trailing-return-type} contains a placeholder type, return type
deduction of the corresponding function call operator template specialization
has to be done. The corresponding specialization is that instantiation of the
function call operator template with the same template arguments as those
deduced for the conversion function template.  Consider the following:

A function call is a postfix expression followed by parentheses
containing a possibly empty, comma-separated list of
\grammarterm{initializer-clause}{s} which
constitute the arguments to the function. The postfix expression shall
have function type or pointer to function type.
For a call to a non-member function or to a static member function,
the postfix expression shall be either an lvalue that refers to a
function (in which case the function-to-pointer standard
conversion~(\ref{conv.func}) is suppressed on the postfix expression),
or it shall have pointer to function type. Calling a function through an
expression whose function type has a language linkage that is different
from the language linkage of the function type of the called function's
definition is undefined~(\ref{dcl.link}). For a call to a non-static
member function,
the postfix expression shall be an
implicit~(\ref{class.mfct.non-static},~\ref{class.static}) or explicit
class member access~(\ref{expr.ref}) whose \grammarterm{id-expression} is a
function member name, or a pointer-to-member
expression~(\ref{expr.mptr.oper}) selecting a function member; the call is as a member of
the class object referred to by the
object expression. In the case of an implicit class
member access, the implied object is the one pointed to by \tcode{this}.
\enternote 
a member function call of the form \tcode{f()} is interpreted as

member access expression is a \grammarterm{qualified-id}, that function is
called. Otherwise, its final overrider~(\ref{class.virtual}) in the dynamic type
of the object expression is called; such a call is referred to as a
\term{virtual function call}.
\enternote 
the dynamic type is the type of the object referred to by the

\exitnote 
During the initialization of a parameter, an implementation may avoid
the construction of extra temporaries by combining the conversions on
the associated argument and/or the construction of temporaries with the
initialization of the parameter (see~\ref{class.temporary}). The
lifetime of a parameter ends when the function in which it is defined
returns. The initialization and destruction of each parameter occurs
within the context of the calling function.

the access of the constructor, conversion functions or destructor is

this handler is not considered.

A value of floating-point type can also be explicitly converted to an enumeration type.
The resulting value is the same as converting the original value to the
underlying type of the enumeration~(\ref{conv.fpint}), and subsequently to
the enumeration type.

\pnum
\indextext{cast!base~class}%

``pointer to \cvqual{cv1} \tcode{B}'' points to a \tcode{B} that is
actually a subobject of an object of type \tcode{D}, the resulting
pointer points to the enclosing object of type \tcode{D}. Otherwise, the
behavior is undefined.

as, or greater cv-qualification than, \cvqual{cv1}.\footnote{Function types
(including those used in pointer to member function
types) are never cv-qualified; see~\ref{dcl.fct}.}
The null member pointer value~(\ref{conv.mem}) is converted to the null
member pointer value of the destination type. If class \tcode{B}
contains the original member, or is a base or derived class of the class
containing the original member, the resulting pointer to member points
to the original member. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
\enternote 
although class \tcode{B} need not contain the original member, the

cv-qualification as, or greater cv-qualification than, \cvqual{cv1}. The
null pointer value is converted to the null pointer value of the

\tcode{A} of a byte in memory and \tcode{A} satisfies the alignment
requirement of \tcode{T}, then the resulting pointer value represents the same
address as the original pointer value, that is, \tcode{A}. The result of any
other such pointer conversion is unspecified.

constness}. In these rules \tcode{T\term{n} } and \tcode{X\term{n} }
represent types. For two pointer types:

\tcode{X1} is \tcode{T1}$\mathit{cv}_{1,1}$ \tcode{*} $\cdots$
$\mathit{cv}_{1,N}$ \tcode{*} where \tcode{T1} is not a pointer type

\end{indented}

\begin{indented}
$K$ is $\min (N,M)$
\end{indented}

casting from \tcode{X1} to \tcode{X2} casts away constness if, for a
non-pointer type \tcode{T} there does not exist an implicit conversion
(Clause~\ref{conv}) from:

\begin{indented}
\tcode{T}$\mathit{cv}_{1,(N-K+1)}$ \tcode{*} $\mathit{cv}_{1,(N-K+2)}$

Casting from an lvalue of type \tcode{T1} to an lvalue of type
\tcode{T2} using an lvalue reference cast
or casting from an expression of type \tcode{T1} to an xvalue of type \tcode{T2} using
an rvalue reference cast
casts away constness if a cast from a prvalue of type ``pointer to \tcode{T1}'' to the type ``pointer to
\tcode{T2}'' casts away constness.

\pnum
Casting from a prvalue of type ``pointer to data member of \tcode{X} of
type \tcode{T1}'' to the type ``pointer to data member of \tcode{Y} of
type \tcode{T2}'' casts away constness if a cast from a prvalue of type
``pointer to \tcode{T1}'' to the type ``pointer to \tcode{T2}'' casts
away constness.

For multi-level pointer to members and multi-level mixed pointers and
pointer to members~(\ref{conv.qual}), the ``member'' aspect of a pointer
to member level is ignored when determining if a \tcode{const}
cv-qualifier has been cast away.

\pnum
\enternote 
some conversions which involve only changes in cv-qualification cannot
be done using \tcode{const_cast.} For instance, conversions between
pointers to functions are not covered because such conversions lead to
values whose use causes undefined behavior. For the same reasons,
conversions between pointers to member functions, and in particular, the
conversion from a pointer to a const member function to a pointer to a
non-const member function, are not covered.

The result of the binary \tcode{+} operator is the sum of the operands.

\indextext{arithmetic!pointer}%
For the purposes of these operators, a pointer to a nonarray object
behaves the same as a pointer to the first element of an array of length
one with the type of the object as its element type.

\pnum
When an expression that has integral type is added to or subtracted from
a pointer, the result has the type of the pointer operand. If the
pointer operand points to an element of an array object, and the array
is large enough, the result points to an element offset from the
original element such that the difference of the subscripts of the
resulting and original array elements equals the integral expression. In
other words, if the expression \tcode{P} points to the $i$-th element of
an array object, the expressions \tcode{(P)+N} (equivalently,
\tcode{N+(P)}) and \tcode{(P)-N} (where \tcode{N} has the value $n$)
point to, respectively, the $i+n$-th and $i-n$-th elements of the array
object, provided they exist. Moreover, if the expression \tcode{P}
points to the last element of an array object, the expression
\tcode{(P)+1} points one past the last element of the array object, and
if the expression \tcode{Q} points one past the last element of an array
object, the expression \tcode{(Q)-1} points to the last element of the
array object. If both the pointer operand and the result point to
elements of the same array object, or one past the last element of the
array object, the evaluation shall not produce an overflow; otherwise,
the behavior is undefined.

When two pointers to elements of the same array object are subtracted,
the result is the difference of the subscripts of the two array
elements. The type of the result is an \impldef{type of \tcode{ptrdiff_t}} signed
integral type; this type shall be the same type that is defined as
\tcode{std::ptrdiff_t} in the \tcode{<cstddef>}
header~(\ref{support.types}). As with any other arithmetic overflow, if
the result does not fit in the space provided, the behavior is
undefined. In other words, if the expressions \tcode{P} and \tcode{Q}
point to, respectively, the $i$-th and $j$-th elements of an array
object, the expression \tcode{(P)-(Q)} has the value $i-j$ provided the
value fits in an object of type \tcode{std::ptrdiff_t}. Moreover, if the
expression \tcode{P} points either to an element of an array object or
one past the last element of an array object, and the expression
\tcode{Q} points to the last element of the same array object, the
expression \tcode{((Q)+1)-(P)} has the same value as \tcode{((Q)-(P))+1}
and as \tcode{-((P)-((Q)+1))}, and has the value zero if the expression
\tcode{P} points one past the last element of the array object, even
though the expression \tcode{(Q)+1} does not point to an element of the
array object. Unless both pointers point to elements of the same array
object, or one past the last element of the array object, the behavior
is undefined.\footnote{Another way to approach pointer arithmetic is first to convert the
pointer(s) to character pointer(s): In this scheme the integral value of
the expression added to or subtracted from the converted pointer is
first multiplied by the size of the object originally pointed to, and
the resulting pointer is converted back to the original type. For
pointer subtraction, the result of the difference between the character
pointers is similarly divided by the size of the object originally
pointed to.

When viewed in this way, an implementation need only provide one extra
byte (which might overlap another object in the program) just after the
end of the object in order to satisfy the ``one past the last element''
requirements.}

\pnum
For addition or subtraction, if the expressions \tcode{P} or \tcode{Q} have
type ``pointer to \cv\ \tcode{T}'', where \tcode{T} is different from the
cv-unqualified array element type, the behavior is undefined.
\enternote In particular, a pointer to a base class cannot be used for
pointer arithmetic when the array contains objects of a derived class type.
\exitnote

\pnum
If the value 0 is added to or subtracted from a pointer value, the
result compares equal to the original pointer value. If two pointers
point to the same object or both point one past the end of the same
array or both are null, and the two pointers are subtracted, the result
compares equal to the value 0 converted to the type
\tcode{std::ptrdiff_t}.

Otherwise, if the second and third operand have different types and
either has (possibly cv-qualified) class type, or if both

cv-qualification, an attempt is made to

determining whether an operand expression \tcode{E1} of type \tcode{T1}
can be converted to match an operand expression \tcode{E2} of type
\tcode{T2} is defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{E2} is an lvalue: \tcode{E1} can be converted to match
\tcode{E2} if \tcode{E1} can be implicitly converted (Clause~\ref{conv})
to the type ``lvalue reference to \tcode{T2}'', subject to the
constraint that in the conversion the reference must bind
directly~(\ref{dcl.init.ref}) to an lvalue.

\item If \tcode{E2} is an xvalue: \tcode{E1} can be converted to match \tcode{E2}
if \tcode{E1} can be implicitly converted to the type ``rvalue reference to \tcode{T2}'',
subject to the constraint that the reference must bind directly.

\item If \tcode{E2} is a prvalue or if neither of the conversions above can be
done and at least one of the operands has (possibly cv-qualified) class type:

\begin{itemize}
\item if \tcode{E1} and \tcode{E2} have class type, and the underlying
class types are the same or one is a base class of the other: \tcode{E1}
can be converted to match \tcode{E2} if the class of \tcode{T2} is the
same type as, or a base class of, the class of \tcode{T1}, and the
cv-qualification of \tcode{T2} is the same cv-qualification as, or a
greater cv-qualification than, the cv-qualification of \tcode{T1}. If
the conversion is applied, \tcode{E1} is changed to a prvalue of type
\tcode{T2} by copy-initializing a temporary of type \tcode{T2} from
\tcode{E1} and using that temporary as the converted operand.

\item Otherwise (i.e., if \tcode{E1} or \tcode{E2} has a nonclass type,
or if they both have class types but the underlying classes are not
either the same or one a base class of the other): \tcode{E1} can be
converted to match \tcode{E2} if \tcode{E1} can be implicitly converted
to the type that expression \tcode{E2} would have if \tcode{E2} were
converted to a prvalue (or the type it has,
if \tcode{E2} is a prvalue).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Using this process, it is determined whether the second operand can be
converted to match the third operand, and whether the third operand can
be converted to match the second operand. If both can be converted, or
one can be converted but the conversion is ambiguous, the program is
ill-formed. If neither can be converted, the operands are left unchanged
and further checking is performed as described below. If exactly one
conversion is possible, that conversion is applied to the chosen operand
and the converted operand is used in place of the original operand for
the remainder of this section.

\pnum
If the second and third operands are glvalues of the same value category
and have the same type, the
result is of that type and value category and it is a bit-field if the
second or the third operand is a bit-field, or if both are bit-fields.

\pnum
Otherwise, the result is a prvalue. If the second and third operands do
not have the same type, and either has (possibly cv-qualified) class
type, overload resolution is used to determine the conversions (if any)
to be applied to the operands~(\ref{over.match.oper},~\ref{over.built}).
If the overload resolution fails, the program is ill-formed. Otherwise,
the conversions thus determined are applied, and the converted operands
are used in place of the original operands for the remainder of this
section.

\pnum
Lvalue-to-rvalue~(\ref{conv.lval}), array-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.array}),
and function-to-pointer~(\ref{conv.func}) standard conversions are
performed on the second and third operands. After those conversions, one
of the following shall hold:

\begin{itemize}
\item The second and third operands have the same type; the result is of
that type. If the operands have class type, the result is a prvalue
temporary of the result type, which is copy-initialized from either the
second operand or the third operand depending on the value of the first
operand.

\item The second and third operands have arithmetic or enumeration type;
the usual arithmetic conversions are performed to bring them to a common
type, and the result is of that type.

\item One or both of the second and third operands have pointer type; pointer
conversions~(\ref{conv.ptr}) and qualification
conversions~(\ref{conv.qual}) are performed to bring them to their
composite pointer type (Clause~\ref{expr}). The result is of the composite
pointer type.

\item One or both of the second and third operands have pointer to member type;
pointer to member conversions~(\ref{conv.mem}) and qualification
conversions~(\ref{conv.qual}) are performed to bring them to their composite
pointer type (Clause~\ref{expr}). The result is of the composite pointer type.

\item
Both the second and third operands have type \tcode{std::nullptr_t} or one has

A pair of expressions separated by a comma is evaluated left-to-right;
the left expression is
a discarded-value expression (Clause~\ref{expr}).\footnote{However, an

the evaluations of its argument expressions are unsequenced relative to one
another~(see \ref{intro.execution}).}

associated with the left expression is sequenced before every value
computation and side effect associated with the right expression.
