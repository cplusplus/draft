The default constructor~(\ref{class.ctor}),
copy constructor and copy assignment operator~(\ref{class.copy}),
move constructor and move assignment operator~(\ref{class.copy}),
and destructor~(\ref{class.dtor}) are
\term{special member functions}.
\begin{note} The implementation will implicitly declare these member functions for some class
types when the program does not explicitly declare them.
The implementation will implicitly define them if they are odr-used~(\ref{basic.def.odr}).
See~\ref{class.ctor}, \ref{class.dtor} and~\ref{class.copy}. \end{note}
An implicitly-declared special member function is declared at the closing
\tcode{\}} of the \grammarterm{class-specifier}.
Programs shall not define implicitly-declared special member functions.

\pnum
Programs may explicitly refer to implicitly-declared special member functions.
\begin{example}
A program may explicitly call, take the address of, or form a pointer to member
to an implicitly-declared special member function.

\begin{codeblock}
struct A { };                   // implicitly declared \tcode{A::operator=}
struct B : A {
  B& operator=(const B &);
};
B& B::operator=(const B& s) {
  this->A::operator=(s);        // well formed
  return *this;
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
The special member functions affect the way objects of class type are created,
copied, moved, and destroyed, and how values can be converted to values of other types.
Often such special member functions are called implicitly.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{access control!member function and}%
Special member functions obey the usual access rules (Clause~\ref{class.access}).
\begin{example}
declaring a constructor
\tcode{protected}
ensures that only derived classes and friends can create objects using it.
\end{example}

\pnum
For a class, its non-static data members, its non-virtual direct base classes,
and, if the class is not abstract~(\ref{class.abstract}), its virtual base
classes are called its \term{potentially constructed subobjects}.

\rSec1[class.ctor]{Constructors}%
\indextext{constructor}

\pnum
Constructors do not have names.
In a declaration of a constructor, the \grammarterm{declarator} is a
function declarator~(\ref{dcl.fct}) of the form

\begin{ncbnf}
ptr-declarator \terminal{(} parameter-declaration-clause \terminal{)} noexcept-specifier\opt attribute-specifier-seq\opt
\end{ncbnf}

where the \grammarterm{ptr-declarator} consists solely of an
\grammarterm{id-expression}, an optional \grammarterm{attribute-specifier-seq},
and optional surrounding parentheses, and the \grammarterm{id-expression} has
one of the following forms:

\begin{itemize}
\item
in a \grammarterm{member-declaration} that belongs to the
\grammarterm{member-specification} of a class but is not a friend
declaration~(\ref{class.friend}), the \grammarterm{id-expression} is the
injected-class-name (Clause~\ref{class}) of the immediately-enclosing class;

\item
in a \grammarterm{member-declaration} that belongs to the
\grammarterm{member-specification} of a class template but is not a friend
declaration, the \grammarterm{id-expression} is a \grammarterm{class-name} that
names the current instantiation~(\ref{temp.dep.type}) of the
immediately-enclosing class template; or

\item
in a declaration at namespace scope or in a friend declaration, the
\grammarterm{id-expression} is a \grammarterm{qualified-id} that names a
constructor~(\ref{class.qual}).
\end{itemize}

The \grammarterm{class-name} shall not be a \grammarterm{typedef-name}. In a constructor
declaration, each \grammarterm{decl-specifier} in the optional
\grammarterm{decl-specifier-seq} shall be \tcode{friend}, \tcode{inline},
\tcode{explicit}, or \tcode{constexpr}.
\begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  S();              // declares the constructor
};

S::S() { }          // defines the constructor
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
A constructor is used to initialize objects of its class type.
Because constructors do not have names, they are never found during
name lookup; however an explicit type conversion using the functional
notation~(\ref{expr.type.conv}) will cause a constructor to be called to
initialize an object.
\begin{note}
For initialization of objects of class type see~\ref{class.init}.

\tcode{X}

has a default argument
(including the case of a constructor with no parameters).
\indextext{implicitly-declared default constructor}%
If there is no user-declared constructor for class
\tcode{X},
a non-explicit constructor having no parameters is implicitly declared
as defaulted~(\ref{dcl.fct.def}).
An implicitly-declared default constructor is an
\tcode{inline}
\tcode{public}
member of its class.

\pnum
A defaulted default constructor for class \tcode{X} is defined as deleted if:

\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{X} is a union that has a variant member

no variant member of \tcode{X} has a default member initializer,
    
\item \tcode{X} is a non-union class that has a variant member \tcode{M}
with a non-trivial default constructor and
no variant member of the anonymous union containing \tcode{M}
has a default member initializer,

\item any non-static data member with no default member initializer~(\ref{class.mem}) is
of reference type,

\item any non-variant non-static data member of const-qualified type (or array
thereof) with no \grammarterm{brace-or-equal-initializer} does not have a user-provided default constructor,

\item \tcode{X} is a union and all of its variant members are of const-qualified
type (or array thereof),

\item \tcode{X} is a non-union class and all members of any anonymous union member are
of const-qualified type (or array thereof),

\item any potentially constructed subobject, except for a non-static data member
with a \grammarterm{brace-or-equal-initializer}, has
class type \tcode{M} (or array thereof) and either \tcode{M}
has no default constructor or overload resolution
(\ref{over.match}) as applied to find \tcode{M}'s corresponding
constructor results in an ambiguity or in a function that is deleted or
inaccessible from the defaulted default constructor, or

\item any potentially constructed subobject has a type
with a destructor that is deleted or inaccessible from the defaulted default
constructor.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
A default constructor is
trivial
if it is not user-provided and if:

\begin{itemize}
\item
its class has no virtual functions~(\ref{class.virtual}) and no virtual base
classes~(\ref{class.mi}), and

\item no non-static data member of its class has
a default member initializer~(\ref{class.mem}), and

\item
all the direct base classes of its class have trivial default constructors, and

\item
for all the non-static data members of its class that are of class
type (or array thereof), each such class has a trivial default constructor.
\end{itemize}

Otherwise, the default constructor is
\grammarterm{non-trivial}.

\pnum
\indextext{constructor!implicitly defined}%
A default constructor
that is defaulted and not defined as deleted
is
\term{implicitly defined}
when it is odr-used~(\ref{basic.def.odr})
to create an object of its class type~(\ref{intro.object})
or when it is explicitly defaulted after its first declaration.
The implicitly-defined default constructor performs the set of
initializations of the class that would be performed by a user-written default
constructor for that class with no
\grammarterm{ctor-initializer}~(\ref{class.base.init}) and an empty
\grammarterm{compound-statement}.
If that user-written default constructor would be ill-formed,
the program is ill-formed.
If that user-written default constructor would satisfy the requirements
of a constexpr constructor~(\ref{dcl.constexpr}), the implicitly-defined
default constructor is \tcode{constexpr}.
Before the defaulted default constructor for a class is
implicitly defined,
all the non-user-provided default constructors for its base classes and
its non-static data members shall have been implicitly defined.
\begin{note}
An implicitly-declared default constructor has an
exception specification~(\ref{except.spec}).
An explicitly-defaulted definition might have an
implicit exception specification, see~\ref{dcl.fct.def}.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{constructor!implicitly called}%
Default constructors are called implicitly to create class objects of static, thread,

are called to create class objects of dynamic storage duration~(\ref{basic.stc.dynamic}) created by a
\grammarterm{new-expression}

Temporary objects are created
\begin{itemize}
\item

\item
when needed by the implementation to pass or return an object of trivially-copyable type (see below),

\begin{note}
The lifetime of exception objects is described in~\ref{except.throw}.
\end{note}
\end{itemize}
Even when the creation of the temporary object is
unevaluated (Clause~\ref{expr}),
all the semantic restrictions shall be respected as if the temporary object
had been created and later destroyed.
\begin{note}
This includes accessibility~(\ref{class.access}) and whether it is deleted,
for the constructor selected and for the destructor. However, in the special
case of the operand of a
\grammarterm{decltype-specifier}~(\ref{expr.call}), no temporary is introduced,
so the foregoing does not apply to such a prvalue.
\end{note}

\pnum
The materialization of a temporary object is generally
delayed as long as possible
in order to avoid creating unnecessary temporary objects.
\begin{note}
Temporary objects are materialized:
\begin{itemize}
\item
when binding a reference to a prvalue~(\ref{dcl.init.ref}, \ref{expr.type.conv},
\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}, \ref{expr.static.cast}, \ref{expr.const.cast}, \ref{expr.cast}),
\item
when performing member access on a class prvalue~(\ref{expr.ref}, \ref{expr.mptr.oper}),
\item
when performing an array-to-pointer conversion or subscripting on an array prvalue~(\ref{conv.array}, \ref{expr.sub}),
\item
when initializing an object of type \tcode{std::initializer_list<T>} from a \grammarterm{braced-init-list}~(\ref{dcl.init.list}),
\item
for certain unevaluated operands~(\ref{expr.typeid}, \ref{expr.sizeof}), and
\item
when a prvalue appears as a discarded-value expression (Clause~\ref{expr}).
\end{itemize}
\end{note}
\begin{example} Consider the following code:
\begin{codeblock}
class X {
public:
  X(int);
  X(const X&);
  X& operator=(const X&);
  ~X();
};

class Y {
public:
  Y(int);
  Y(Y&&);
  ~Y();
};

X f(X);
Y g(Y);

void h() {
  X a(1);
  X b = f(X(2));
  Y c = g(Y(3));
  a = f(a);
}
\end{codeblock}

\indextext{class object copy|see{constructor, copy}}%
\indextext{constructor!copy}%
\tcode{X(2)} is constructed in the space used to hold \tcode{f()}'s argument and
\tcode{Y(3)} is constructed in the space used to hold \tcode{g()}'s argument.
Likewise,
\tcode{f()}'s result is constructed directly in \tcode{b} and
\tcode{g()}'s result is constructed directly in \tcode{c}.
On the other hand, the expression
\tcode{a = f(a)}
requires a temporary for
the result of \tcode{f(a)},
which is materialized so that the reference parameter
of \tcode{A::operator=(const A\&)} can bind to it.
\end{example}

\pnum
When an object of class type \tcode{X}
is passed to or returned from a function,
if each copy constructor, move constructor, and destructor of \tcode{X}
is either trivial or deleted,
and \tcode{X}
has at least one non-deleted copy or move constructor,
implementations are permitted
to create a temporary object
to hold the function parameter or result object.
The temporary object is constructed
from the function argument or return value, respectively,
and the function's parameter or return object
is initialized as if by
using the non-deleted trivial constructor to copy the temporary
(even if that constructor is inaccessible
or would not be selected by overload resolution
to perform a copy or move of the object).
\begin{note}
This latitude is granted to allow objects of class type to be passed to or returned from functions in registers.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{temporary!constructor for}%
\indextext{temporary!destructor for}%
\indextext{temporary!destruction of}%
When an implementation introduces a temporary object of a class that has a
non-trivial constructor~(\ref{class.ctor}, \ref{class.copy}), it shall ensure that
a constructor is called for the temporary object.
Similarly, the destructor shall be called for a temporary with a non-trivial
destructor~(\ref{class.dtor}).
Temporary objects are destroyed as the last step
in evaluating
the full-expression~(\ref{intro.execution})
that (lexically) contains the point where
they were created.
This is true even if that evaluation ends in throwing an exception.
The
\indextext{value computation}%
value computations and
\indextext{side effects}%
side effects of destroying a temporary object
are associated only with the full-expression, not with any specific
subexpression.

\pnum
\indextext{initializer!temporary and declarator}%
\indextext{temporary!order of destruction of}%
There are three contexts in which temporaries are destroyed at a different
point than the end of the full-expression.
The first context is when a default constructor is called to initialize
an element of an array with no corresponding initializer~(\ref{dcl.init}).
The second context is when a copy constructor is called to copy an element of
an array while the entire array is copied~(\ref{expr.prim.lambda},~\ref{class.copy}).
In either case, if the constructor has one or more default arguments,
the destruction of every temporary created in a default argument is
sequenced before the construction of the next array element, if any.

\pnum
The third context is when a reference is bound to a
temporary.\footnote{The same rules apply to initialization of an
  \tcode{initializer_list} object~(\ref{dcl.init.list}) with its
  underlying temporary array.}
The temporary to which the reference is bound or the temporary
that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound
persists for the lifetime of the reference except:

\begin{itemize}
\item A temporary object bound to a reference parameter in a function call~(\ref{expr.call})
persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the call.

\item The lifetime of a temporary bound to the returned value in a function return statement~(\ref{stmt.return}) is not extended; the temporary is destroyed at the end of the full-expression in the return statement.

\item A temporary bound to a reference in a \grammarterm{new-initializer}~(\ref{expr.new}) persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the \grammarterm{new-initializer}. \begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S { int mi; const std::pair<int,int>& mp; };
S a { 1, {2,3} };
S* p = new S{ 1, {2,3} };   // Creates dangling reference
\end{codeblock}
\end{example} \begin{note} This may introduce a dangling reference, and implementations are encouraged to issue a warning in such a case. \end{note}
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The destruction of a temporary whose lifetime is not extended by being
bound to a reference is sequenced before the destruction of every
temporary which is constructed earlier in the same full-expression.
If the lifetime of two or more temporaries to which references are bound ends
at the same point,
these temporaries are destroyed at that point in the reverse order of the
completion of their construction.
In addition, the destruction of temporaries bound to references shall
take into account the ordering of destruction of objects with static, thread, or
automatic storage duration~(\ref{basic.stc.static}, \ref{basic.stc.thread}, \ref{basic.stc.auto});
that is, if
\tcode{obj1}
is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created before the temporary is created 
the temporary shall be destroyed before
\tcode{obj1}
is destroyed;
if
\tcode{obj2}
is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created after the temporary is created
the temporary shall be destroyed after
\tcode{obj2}
is destroyed.

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  S();
  S(int);
  friend S operator+(const S&, const S&);
  ~S();
};
S obj1;
const S& cr = S(16)+S(23);
S obj2;
\end{codeblock}

the expression
\tcode{S(16) + S(23)}
creates three temporaries:
a first temporary
\tcode{T1}
to hold the result of the expression
\tcode{S(16)},
a second temporary
\tcode{T2}
to hold the result of the expression
\tcode{S(23)},
and a third temporary
\tcode{T3}
to hold the result of the addition of these two expressions.
The temporary
\tcode{T3}
is then bound to the reference
\tcode{cr}.
It is unspecified whether
\tcode{T1}
or
\tcode{T2}
is created first.
On an implementation where
\tcode{T1}
is created before
\tcode{T2},
\tcode{T2}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{T1}.
The temporaries
\tcode{T1}
and
\tcode{T2}
are bound to the reference parameters of
\tcode{operator+};
these temporaries are destroyed at the end of the full-expression
containing the call to
\tcode{operator+}.
The temporary
\tcode{T3}
bound to the reference
\tcode{cr}
is destroyed at the end of
\tcode{cr}'s
lifetime, that is, at the end of the program.
In addition, the order in which
\tcode{T3}
is destroyed takes into account the destruction order of other objects with
static storage duration.
That is, because
\tcode{obj1}
is constructed before
\tcode{T3},
and
\tcode{T3}
is constructed before
\tcode{obj2},
\tcode{obj2}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{T3},
and
\tcode{T3}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{obj1}.

The type of the conversion function~(\ref{dcl.fct}) is
``function taking no parameter returning

A conversion function is never used to convert a (possibly cv-qualified) object
to the (possibly cv-qualified) same object type (or a reference to it),
to a (possibly cv-qualified) base class of that type (or a reference to it),
or to (possibly cv-qualified) void.\footnote{These conversions are considered
as standard conversions for the purposes of overload resolution~(\ref{over.best.ics}, \ref{over.ics.ref}) and therefore initialization~(\ref{dcl.init}) and explicit casts~(\ref{expr.static.cast}). A conversion to \tcode{void} does not invoke any conversion function~(\ref{expr.static.cast}).
Even though never directly called to perform a conversion,
such conversion functions can be declared and can potentially
be reached through a call to a virtual conversion function in a base class.}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct X {
  operator int();
  operator auto() -> short;     // error: trailing return type
};

void f(X a) {
  int i = int(a);

Bases and members are destroyed in the reverse order of the completion of
their constructor (see~\ref{class.base.init}).

\grammarterm{delete-expression}.
\begin{note} An array of class type contains several subobjects for each of which
the destructor is invoked. \end{note}
A destructor can also be invoked explicitly. A destructor is \term{potentially invoked}
if it is invoked or as specified in~\ref{expr.new}, \ref{class.base.init},

A program is ill-formed if a destructor that is potentially invoked is deleted

If the lookup fails or if the deallocation function has
a deleted definition~(\ref{dcl.fct.def}), the program is ill-formed.

This assures that a deallocation function corresponding to the dynamic type of an
object is available for the

In an explicit destructor call, the destructor is specified by a

The invocation of a destructor is subject to the usual rules for member
functions~(\ref{class.mfct});
that is, if the object is not of the destructor's class type and
not of a class derived from the destructor's class type (including when
the destructor is invoked via a null pointer value), the program has
undefined behavior.
\begin{note} Invoking \tcode{delete} on a null pointer does not call the
destructor; see \ref{expr.delete}. \end{note}
\begin{example}

struct B {

struct D : B {
  ~D() { }

D D_object;
typedef B B_alias;
B* B_ptr = &D_object;

  B_ptr->~B_alias();            // calls \tcode{D}'s destructor

\end{example}
\begin{note}
An explicit destructor call must always be written using
a member access operator~(\ref{expr.ref}) or a qualified-id~(\ref{expr.prim});
in particular, the
\grammarterm{unary-expression}
\tcode{\~{}X()}
in a member function is not an explicit destructor call~(\ref{expr.unary.op}).

\begin{note}
\indextext{object!destructor and placement of}%
Explicit calls of destructors are rarely needed.
One use of such calls is for objects placed at specific
addresses using a placement
\grammarterm{new-expression}.
Such use of explicit placement and destruction of objects can be necessary
to cope with dedicated hardware resources and for writing memory management
facilities.
For example,
\indextext{example!explicit destructor call}%
\begin{codeblock}
void* operator new(std::size_t, void* p) { return p; }

  X* p = new(buf) X(222);       // use \tcode{buf[]} and initialize
  f(p);
  p->X::~X();                   // cleanup
}

\pnum
Once a destructor is invoked for an object, the object no longer exists;
the behavior is undefined if the destructor is invoked
for an object whose lifetime has ended~(\ref{basic.life}).

and the block is subsequently left in a manner that would ordinarily
invoke implicit destruction of the object, the behavior is undefined.

the object~(\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation}).

\pnum
Class-specific deallocation function lookup is a part of general deallocation
function lookup~(\ref{expr.delete}) and occurs as follows.
If the \grammarterm{delete-expression}
is used to deallocate a class object whose static type has a virtual
destructor, the deallocation function is the one selected at the point
of definition of the dynamic type's virtual
destructor~(\ref{class.dtor}).\footnote{A similar provision is not needed for
the array version of \tcode{operator} \tcode{delete} because~\ref{expr.delete}
requires that in this situation, the static type of the object to be deleted be
the same as its dynamic type.
}
Otherwise, if the
\grammarterm{delete-expression}
is used to deallocate an object of class
\tcode{T}
or array thereof, the static and dynamic types of the object shall be
identical and the deallocation function's name is looked up in the scope of
\tcode{T}.
If this lookup fails to find the name, general deallocation function
lookup~(\ref{expr.delete}) continues.
If the result of the lookup is ambiguous or inaccessible, or if the lookup
selects a placement deallocation function, the program is ill-formed.

because the deallocation function actually called is looked up in the scope of
the class that is the dynamic type of the object,
if the destructor is virtual, the effect is the same.
For example,
\begin{codeblock}
struct B {

struct D : B {
  void operator delete(void*);
};

void f() {

\tcode{D::operator delete()},
due to the virtual destructor.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
Virtual destructors have no effect on the deallocation function actually
called when the
\grammarterm{cast-expression}

For example,
\begin{codeblock}

Access to the deallocation function is checked statically.

The target constructor is selected by overload resolution.
Once the target constructor returns, the body of the delegating constructor

virtual base classes are initialized in the order they appear on a

where ``left-to-right'' is the order of appearance of the base classes
in the derived class
\grammarterm{base-specifier-list}.

\indextext{initialization!order of member}%
Then, non-static data members are initialized in the order
they were declared in the class definition

\item
Finally, the \grammarterm{compound-statement} of the constructor

\indexdefn{copy elision|see{constructor, copy, elision; constructor, move, elision}}%
\indexdefn{elision!copy|see{constructor, copy, elision; constructor, move, elision}}%
\indexdefn{constructor!copy!elision}\indexdefn{constructor!move!elision}\term{copy elision},
is permitted in the
following circumstances (which may be combined to
eliminate multiple copies):

\begin{itemize}
\item in a \tcode{return} statement in a function with a class return type,
when the \grammarterm{expression} is the name of a non-volatile
automatic object (other than a function parameter or a variable
introduced by the \grammarterm{exception-declaration} of a
\grammarterm{handler}~(\ref{except.handle}))
with the same type (ignoring cv-qualification) as
the function return type, the copy/move operation can be
omitted by constructing the automatic object directly
into the function call's return object

\item in a \grammarterm{throw-expression}~(\ref{expr.throw}), when the operand
is the name of a non-volatile automatic object
(other than a function or catch-clause parameter)
whose scope does not extend beyond the end of the innermost enclosing
\grammarterm{try-block} (if there is one), the copy/move operation from the
operand to the exception object~(\ref{except.throw}) can be omitted by
constructing the automatic object directly into the exception object

\item when the \grammarterm{exception-declaration} of an
exception handler (Clause~\ref{except}) declares an object of the same
type (except for cv-qualification) as the exception
object~(\ref{except.throw}), the copy operation can be omitted by treating
the \grammarterm{exception-declaration} as an alias for the exception
object if the meaning of the program will be unchanged except for the execution
of constructors and destructors for the object declared by the
\grammarterm{exception-declaration}.
\begin{note} There cannot be a move from the exception object because it is
always an lvalue.  \end{note}
\end{itemize}
Copy elision is required
where an expression is evaluated in a context
requiring a constant expression~(\ref{expr.const})
and in constant initialization~(\ref{basic.start.static}).
\begin{note}
Copy elision might not be performed
if the same expression
is evaluated in another context.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
class Thing {
public:
  Thing();
  ~Thing();
  Thing(const Thing&);
};

Thing f() {
  Thing t;
  return t;
}

Thing t2 = f();

struct A {
  void *p;
  constexpr A(): p(this) {}
};

constexpr A g() {
  A a;
  return a;
}

constexpr A a;          // well-formed, \tcode{a.p} points to \tcode{a}
constexpr A b = g();    // well-formed, \tcode{b.p} points to \tcode{b}

void g() {
  A c = g();            // well-formed, \tcode{c.p} may point to \tcode{c} or to an ephemeral temporary
}
\end{codeblock}
Here the criteria for elision can
eliminate
the copying of the local automatic object
\tcode{t}
into the result object for the function call
\tcode{f()},
which is the global object
\tcode{t2}.
Effectively, the construction of the local object
\tcode{t}
can be viewed as directly initializing the global
object
\tcode{t2},
and that object's destruction will occur at program
exit.
Adding a move constructor to \tcode{Thing} has the same effect, but it is the
move construction from the local automatic object to \tcode{t2} that is elided.
\end{example}

\pnum
In the following copy-initialization contexts, a move operation might be used instead of a copy operation:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the \grammarterm{expression} in a \tcode{return} statement~(\ref{stmt.return})
is a (possibly parenthesized) \grammarterm{id-expression}
that names an object with automatic storage duration declared in the body
or \grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause} of the innermost enclosing
function or \grammarterm{lambda-expression}, or

\item if the operand of a \grammarterm{throw-expression}~(\ref{expr.throw})
is the name of a non-volatile automatic object
(other than a function or catch-clause parameter)
whose scope does not extend beyond the end of the innermost enclosing
\grammarterm{try-block} (if there is one),
\end{itemize}
overload resolution to select the constructor
for the copy is first performed as if the object were designated by an
rvalue.
If the first overload resolution fails or was not performed,
or if the type of the first parameter of the selected
constructor is not an rvalue reference to the object's type (possibly cv-qualified),
overload resolution is performed again, considering the object as an lvalue.
\begin{note}
This two-stage overload resolution must be performed regardless
of whether copy elision will occur. It determines the constructor to be called if
elision is not performed, and the selected constructor must be accessible even if
the call is elided.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
class Thing {
public:
  Thing();
  ~Thing();
  Thing(Thing&&);
private:
  Thing(const Thing&);
};

Thing f(bool b) {
  Thing t;
  if (b)
    throw t;            // OK: \tcode{Thing(Thing\&\&)} used (or elided) to throw \tcode{t}
  return t;             // OK: \tcode{Thing(Thing\&\&)} used (or elided) to return \tcode{t}
}

Thing t2 = f(false);    // OK: no extra copy/move performed, \tcode{t2} constructed by call to \tcode{f}

struct Weird {
  Weird();
  Weird(Weird&);
};

Weird g() {
  Weird w;
  return w;             // OK: first overload resolution fails, second overload resolution selects \tcode{Weird(Weird\&)}
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
