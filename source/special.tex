Constructors do not have names.
A special declarator syntax is used to declare or define the constructor.
The syntax uses:

\begin{itemize}
\item an optional \grammarterm{decl-specifier-seq} in which each
\grammarterm{decl-specifier} is either a \grammarterm{function-specifier} or \tcode{constexpr},
\item the constructor's class name, and
\item a parameter list
\end{itemize}

in that order.
In such a declaration, optional parentheses around the constructor class name
are ignored.

\pnum
A constructor is used to initialize objects of its class type.
Because constructors do not have names, they are never found during
name lookup; however an explicit type conversion using the functional
notation~(\ref{expr.type.conv}) will cause a constructor to be called to
initialize an object.

A

\tcode{X}

\indextext{implicitly-declared~default~constructor}%
If there is no user-declared constructor for class
\tcode{X},
a constructor having no parameters is implicitly declared
as defaulted~(\ref{dcl.fct.def}).
An implicitly-declared default constructor is an
\tcode{inline}
\tcode{public}
member of its class.
A defaulted default constructor for class \tcode{X} is defined as deleted if:

\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{X} is a union-like class that has a variant
  member with a non-trivial default constructor,

\item any non-static data member with no \grammarterm{brace-or-equal-initializer} is of reference type,

\item any non-variant non-static data member of const-qualified type (or array
thereof) with no \grammarterm{brace-or-equal-initializer} does not have a user-provided default constructor,

\item \tcode{X} is a union and all of its variant members are of const-qualified
type (or array thereof),

\item \tcode{X} is a non-union class and all members of any anonymous union member are
of const-qualified type (or array thereof),

\item any direct or virtual base class, or non-static data member
with no \grammarterm{brace-or-equal-initializer}, has
class type \tcode{M} (or array thereof) and either \tcode{M}
has no default constructor or overload resolution
(\ref{over.match}) as applied to \tcode{M}'s default
constructor results in an ambiguity or in a function that is deleted or
inaccessible from the defaulted default constructor, or

\item any direct or virtual base class or non-static data member has a type
with a destructor that is deleted or inaccessible from the defaulted default
constructor.
\end{itemize}

A default constructor is
trivial
if it is not user-provided and if:

\begin{itemize}
\item
its class has no virtual functions~(\ref{class.virtual}) and no virtual base
classes~(\ref{class.mi}), and

\item no non-static data member of its class has a \grammarterm{brace-or-equal-initializer}, and

\item
all the direct base classes of its class have trivial default constructors, and

\item
for all the non-static data members of its class that are of class
type (or array thereof), each such class has a trivial default constructor.
\end{itemize}

Otherwise, the default constructor is
\grammarterm{non-trivial}.

\pnum
\indextext{constructor!implicitly defined}%
A default constructor
that is defaulted and not defined as deleted
is
\term{implicitly defined}
when it is odr-used~(\ref{basic.def.odr})
to create an object of its class type~(\ref{intro.object})
or when it is explicitly defaulted after its first declaration.
The implicitly-defined default constructor performs the set of
initializations of the class that would be performed by a user-written default
constructor for that class with no
\grammarterm{ctor-initializer}~(\ref{class.base.init}) and an empty
\grammarterm{compound-statement}.
If that user-written default constructor would be ill-formed,
the program is ill-formed.
If that user-written default constructor would satisfy the requirements
of a \tcode{constexpr} constructor~(\ref{dcl.constexpr}), the implicitly-defined
default constructor is \tcode{constexpr}.
Before the defaulted default constructor for a class is
implicitly defined,
all the non-user-provided default constructors for its base classes and
its non-static data members shall have been implicitly defined.
\enternote
An implicitly-declared default constructor has an

An explicitly-defaulted definition might have an
implicit \grammarterm{exception-specification,} see~\ref{dcl.fct.def}.

\tcode{Y(3)} before passing it to \tcode{g()} using \tcode{Y}'s move constructor;
alternatively, \tcode{Y(3)} might be constructed in the space used to hold the argument.

moving it to \tcode{c} using \tcode{Y}'s move constructor; alternatively, \tcode{g()}'s
result might be constructed in \tcode{c}.

When an implementation introduces a temporary object of a class that has a
non-trivial constructor~(\ref{class.ctor}, \ref{class.copy}), it shall ensure that
a constructor is called for the temporary object.
Similarly, the destructor shall be called for a temporary with a non-trivial
destructor~(\ref{class.dtor}).
Temporary objects are destroyed as the last step
in evaluating
the full-expression~(\ref{intro.execution})
that (lexically) contains the point where
they were created.
This is true even if that evaluation ends in throwing an exception.
The

\pnum
\indextext{initializer!temporary~and declarator}%
\indextext{temporary!order~of destruction~of}%
There are two contexts in which temporaries are destroyed at a different
point than the end of the full-expression.
The first context is when a default constructor is called to initialize an
element of an array. If the constructor has one or more default arguments,
the destruction of every temporary created in
a default argument is sequenced before the construction of the next array element, if any.

\pnum
The second context is when a reference is bound to a
temporary.\footnote{The same rules apply to initialization of an
  \tcode{initializer_list} object~(\ref{dcl.init.list}) with its
  underlying temporary array}
The temporary to which the reference is bound or the temporary
that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound
persists for the lifetime of the reference except:

\begin{itemize}
\item A temporary bound to a reference member in a constructor's ctor-initializer~(\ref{class.base.init}) persists until the constructor exits.

\item A temporary bound to a reference parameter in a function call~(\ref{expr.call})
persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the call.

\item The lifetime of a temporary bound to the returned value in a function return statement~(\ref{stmt.return}) is not extended; the temporary is destroyed at the end of the full-expression in the return statement.

\item A temporary bound to a reference in a \grammarterm{new-initializer}~(\ref{expr.new}) persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the \grammarterm{new-initializer}. \enterexample
\begin{codeblock}
struct S { int mi; const std::pair<int,int>& mp; };
S a { 1, {2,3} };
S* p = new S{ 1, {2,3} };   // Creates dangling reference
\end{codeblock}
\exitexample \enternote This may introduce a dangling reference, and implementations are encouraged to issue a warning in such a case. \exitnote
\end{itemize}

The destruction of a temporary whose lifetime is not extended by being
bound to a reference is sequenced before the destruction of every
temporary which is constructed earlier in the same full-expression.
If the lifetime of two or more temporaries to which references are bound ends
at the same point,
these temporaries are destroyed at that point in the reverse order of the
completion of their construction.
In addition, the destruction of temporaries bound to references shall
take into account the ordering of destruction of objects with static, thread, or
automatic storage duration~(\ref{basic.stc.static}, \ref{basic.stc.thread}, \ref{basic.stc.auto});
that is, if
\tcode{obj1}
is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created before the temporary is created 
the temporary shall be destroyed before
\tcode{obj1}
is destroyed;
if
\tcode{obj2}
is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created after the temporary is created
the temporary shall be destroyed after
\tcode{obj2}
is destroyed.
\enterexample

  friend S operator+(const S&, const S&);
  ~S();
};
S obj1;
const S& cr = S(16)+S(23);
S obj2;
\end{codeblock}

the expression
\tcode{S(16) + S(23)}
creates three temporaries:
a first temporary
\tcode{T1}
to hold the result of the expression
\tcode{S(16)},
a second temporary
\tcode{T2}
to hold the result of the expression
\tcode{S(23)},
and a third temporary
\tcode{T3}
to hold the result of the addition of these two expressions.
The temporary
\tcode{T3}
is then bound to the reference
\tcode{cr}.
It is unspecified whether
\tcode{T1}
or
\tcode{T2}
is created first.
On an implementation where
\tcode{T1}
is created before
\tcode{T2},
\tcode{T2}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{T1}.
The temporaries
\tcode{T1}
and
\tcode{T2}
are bound to the reference parameters of
\tcode{operator+};
these temporaries are destroyed at the end of the full-expression
containing the call to
\tcode{operator+}.
The temporary
\tcode{T3}
bound to the reference
\tcode{cr}
is destroyed at the end of
\tcode{cr}'s
lifetime, that is, at the end of the program.
In addition, the order in which
\tcode{T3}
is destroyed takes into account the destruction order of other objects with
static storage duration.
That is, because
\tcode{obj1}
is constructed before
\tcode{T3},
and
\tcode{T3}
is constructed before
\tcode{obj2},
\tcode{obj2}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{T3},

shall be destroyed before

whose scope does not extend beyond the end of the innermost enclosing
\grammarterm{try-block} (if there is one), the copy/move operation from the
operand to the exception object~(\ref{except.throw}) can be omitted by
constructing the automatic object directly into the exception object

\item when a temporary class object that has not been bound to a
reference~(\ref{class.temporary}) would be copied/moved to a class object with
the same cv-unqualified type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by constructing
the temporary object directly into the target of the omitted copy/move

\item when the \nonterminal{exception-declaration} of an
exception handler (Clause~\ref{except}) declares an object of the same
type (except for cv-qualification) as the exception
object~(\ref{except.throw}), the copy/move operation can be omitted by treating

If overload resolution fails, or if the type of the first parameter of the selected
constructor is not an rvalue reference to the object's type (possibly cv-qualified),
overload resolution is performed again, considering the object as an lvalue.
\enternote This two-stage overload resolution must be performed regardless
of whether copy elision will occur. It determines the constructor to be called if
elision is not performed, and the selected constructor must be accessible even if

\enternote If two \grammarterm{using-declaration}{s} declare inheriting constructors with the same
signatures, the program is ill-formed~(\ref{class.mem}, \ref{over.load}), because an
implicitly-declared constructor introduced by the first \grammarterm{using-declaration} is not a
user-declared constructor and thus does not preclude another declaration of a constructor with the
same signature by a subsequent \grammarterm{using-declaration}. \enterexample

\begin{codeblock}
struct B1 {
  B1(int);
};

struct B2 {
  B2(int);

struct D1 : B1, B2 {
  using B1::B1;
  using B2::B2;

struct D2 : B1, B2 {
  using B1::B1;
  using B2::B2;
  D2(int);          // OK: user declaration supersedes both implicit declarations

An inheriting constructor for a class is implicitly defined when
it is odr-used~(\ref{basic.def.odr}) to
create an object of its class type~(\ref{intro.object}). An implicitly-defined inheriting
constructor performs the set of initializations of the class that would be performed by a
user-written \tcode{inline} constructor for that class with a \grammarterm{mem-initializer-list}
whose only \grammarterm{mem-initializer} has a \grammarterm{mem-initializer-id} that names the base
class denoted in the \grammarterm{nested-name-specifier} of the
\grammarterm{using-declaration} and an \grammarterm{expression-list} as specified below, and where
the \grammarterm{compound-statement} in its function body is empty~(\ref{class.base.init}). If that
user-written constructor would be ill-formed, the program is ill-formed. Each
\grammarterm{expression} in the \grammarterm{expression-list} is of the form
\tcode{static_cast<T\&\&>(p)}, where \tcode{p} is the name of the corresponding constructor
parameter and \tcode{T} is the declared type of \tcode{p}.

Class template \tcode{D} wraps any class and forwards all of its constructors,
while writing a message to the standard log whenever an object of class
\tcode{D} is destroyed. \exitexample%
