When two or more different declarations are specified for a single name
in the same scope, that name is said to be
\grammarterm{overloaded}.
By extension, two declarations in the same scope that declare the same name
but with different types are called
\term{overloaded declarations}.
Only function and function template
declarations can be overloaded; variable and type declarations
cannot be overloaded.

\pnum
When an overloaded function name is used in a call, which overloaded function
declaration is being referenced is determined by comparing the types
of the arguments at the point of use with the types of the parameters
in the overloaded declarations that are visible at the point of use.
This function selection process is called
\term{overload resolution}
and
is defined in~\ref{over.match}.

This restriction applies to explicit declarations in a scope, and between

Member function declarations with the same name and the same

Likewise, member function template declarations with the same name,
the same \grammarterm{parameter-type-list}, and the same template parameter lists cannot be
overloaded if any of them is a
\tcode{static}
member function template declaration.
The types of the implicit object parameters constructed for the member
functions for the purpose of overload resolution~(\ref{over.match.funcs})
are not considered when comparing parameter-type-lists for enforcement of
this rule.
In contrast, if there is no

declarations with the same name and the same parameter-type-list, then
these member function declarations can be overloaded if they differ in
the type of their implicit object parameter.

\pnum
Overload resolution is a mechanism for selecting the best
function to call given a list of expressions that are to be the
arguments of the call and a set of
\term{candidate functions}
that can
be called based on the context of the call.
The selection
criteria for the best function are the number of arguments, how
well the arguments match the parameter-type-list of the
candidate function,
how well (for non-static member functions) the object
matches the implicit object parameter,
and certain other properties of the candidate function.
\enternote
The function selected by overload resolution is not
guaranteed to be appropriate for the context.
Other restrictions,
such as the accessibility of the function, can make its use in
the calling context ill-formed.
\exitnote

\pnum
\indextext{overloading!resolution!contexts}%
Overload resolution selects the function to call in seven distinct
contexts within the language:

\begin{itemize}
\item
invocation of a function named in the function call syntax~(\ref{over.call.func});
\item
invocation of a function call operator, a pointer-to-function
conversion function, a reference-to-pointer-to-function conversion
function, or a reference-to-function
conversion function on a class object named in the function
call syntax~(\ref{over.call.object});
\item
invocation of the operator referenced in an expression~(\ref{over.match.oper});
\item
invocation of a constructor for direct-initialization~(\ref{dcl.init})
of a class object~(\ref{over.match.ctor});
\item
invocation of a user-defined conversion for
copy-initialization~(\ref{dcl.init}) of a class object~(\ref{over.match.copy});
\item
invocation of a conversion function for initialization of an object of a
nonclass type from an expression of class type~(\ref{over.match.conv}); and
\item
invocation of a conversion function for conversion to a glvalue
or class prvalue
to which a reference~(\ref{dcl.init.ref})
will be directly bound~(\ref{over.match.ref}).
\end{itemize}

Each of these contexts defines the set of candidate functions and
the list of arguments in its own unique way.
But, once the
candidate functions and argument lists have been identified, the
selection of the best function is the same in all cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item
First, a subset of the candidate functions (those that have
the proper number of arguments and meet certain other
conditions) is selected to form a set of
\indextext{function!viable}%
viable functions~(\ref{over.match.viable}).
\item
Then the best viable function is selected based on the
implicit conversion sequences~(\ref{over.best.ics}) needed to
match each argument to the corresponding parameter of each
viable function.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
If a best viable function exists and is unique, overload
resolution succeeds and produces it as the result.
Otherwise
overload resolution fails and the invocation is ill-formed.
When overload resolution succeeds,
and the best viable function is not accessible (Clause~\ref{class.access}) in the context
in which it is used,
the program is ill-formed.

\rSec2[over.match.funcs]{Candidate functions and argument lists}%
\indextext{overloading!candidate functions|(}%
\indextext{overloading!argument lists|(}

\pnum
The subclauses of~\ref{over.match.funcs} describe
the set of candidate functions and the argument list submitted to
overload resolution in each of the seven contexts in which
overload resolution is used.
The source transformations and constructions defined
in these subclauses are only for the purpose of describing the
overload resolution process.
An implementation is not required
to use such transformations and constructions.

\pnum
\indextext{member function!overload resolution and}%
\indextext{function!overload resolution and}%
The set of candidate functions can contain both member and non-member
functions to be resolved against the same argument list.
So that argument and parameter lists are comparable within this
heterogeneous set, a member function is considered to have an
extra parameter, called the
\defn{implicit object parameter},
which represents the object for which the member function has been
called.
For the purposes of overload resolution, both static and
non-static member functions have an implicit object parameter,
but constructors do not.

\pnum
Similarly, when appropriate, the context can construct an
argument list that contains an
\defn{implied object argument}
to denote
the object to be operated on.
Since arguments and parameters are
associated by position within their respective lists, the
convention is that the implicit object parameter, if present, is
always the first parameter and the implied object argument, if
present, is always the first argument.

\pnum
For non-static member functions, the type of the implicit object
parameter is

\begin{itemize}
\item ``lvalue reference to \textit{cv} \tcode{X}'' for functions declared
without a \grammarterm{ref-qualifier} or with the
\tcode{\&} \grammarterm{ref-qualifier}
\item ``rvalue reference to \textit{cv} \tcode{X}'' for functions declared with the
\tcode{\&\&} \grammarterm{ref-qualifier}
\end{itemize}

where
\tcode{X}
is the class of which the function is a member and
\textit{cv}
is the cv-qualification on the
member function declaration.
\enterexample
for a
\tcode{const}
member
function of class
\tcode{X},
the extra parameter is assumed to have type
``reference to
\tcode{const X}''.
\exitexample
For conversion functions, the function is considered to be a member of the
class of the implied object argument for the purpose of defining the
type of the implicit object parameter.
For non-conversion functions
introduced by a
\grammarterm{using-declaration}
into a derived class, the function is
considered to be a member of the derived class for the purpose of defining
the type of the implicit object parameter.
For static member functions, the implicit object parameter is considered
to match any object (since if the function is selected, the object is
discarded).
\enternote
No actual type is established for the implicit object parameter
of a static member function, and no attempt will be made to determine a
conversion sequence for that parameter~(\ref{over.match.best}).
\exitnote

\pnum
\indextext{implied object argument!implicit conversion sequences}%
During overload resolution, the implied object argument is
indistinguishable from other arguments.
The implicit object
parameter, however, retains its identity since conversions on the
corresponding argument shall obey these additional rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item
no temporary object can be introduced to hold the argument
for the implicit object parameter; and
\item
no user-defined conversions can be applied to achieve a type
match with it.
\end{itemize}

\indextext{implied object argument!non-static member function and}%
For non-static member functions declared without a \grammarterm{ref-qualifier},
an additional rule applies:

\begin{itemize}
\item
even if the implicit object parameter is not
\tcode{const}-qualified,
an rvalue can be bound to the parameter
as long as in all other respects the argument can be
converted to the type of the implicit object parameter.
\enternote The fact that such an argument is an rvalue does not
affect the ranking of implicit conversion sequences~(\ref{over.ics.rank}).
\exitnote
\end{itemize}

\pnum
Because other than in list-initialization only one user-defined conversion
is allowed
in an
implicit conversion sequence, special rules apply when selecting
the best user-defined conversion~(\ref{over.match.best},

determines the parameter types of
the
function template specializations,
i.e., the parameters of
function template specializations

no template parameter types.

function template specializations

\pnum
Of interest in~\ref{over.call.func} are only those function calls in
which the

ultimately contains a name that
denotes one or more functions that might be called.
Such a
\grammarterm{postfix-expression},
perhaps nested arbitrarily deep in
parentheses, has one of the following forms:

\begin{ncbnf}
postfix-expression:\br
    postfix-expression \terminal{.} id-expression\br
    postfix-expression \terminal{->} id-expression\br
    primary-expression
\end{ncbnf}

These represent two syntactic subcategories of function calls:
qualified function calls and unqualified function calls.

\pnum
In qualified function calls, the name to be resolved is an
\grammarterm{id-expression}
and is preceded by an
\tcode{->}
or
\tcode{.}
operator.
Since the
construct
\tcode{A->B}
is generally equivalent to
\tcode{(*A).B},
the rest of
Clause~\ref{over} assumes, without loss of generality, that all member
function calls have been normalized to the form that uses an
object and the
\tcode{.}
operator.
Furthermore, Clause~\ref{over} assumes that
the
\grammarterm{postfix-expression}
that is the left operand of the
\tcode{.}
operator
has type ``\textit{cv}
\tcode{T}''
where
\tcode{T}
denotes a class\footnote{Note that cv-qualifiers on the type of objects are
significant in overload
resolution for
both glvalue and class prvalue objects.}.
Under this
assumption, the
\grammarterm{id-expression}
in the call is looked up as a
member function of
\tcode{T}
following the rules for looking up names in
classes~(\ref{class.member.lookup}).
The function declarations found by that lookup constitute the set of
candidate functions.
The argument list is the
\grammarterm{expression-list}
in the call augmented by the addition of the left operand of
the
\tcode{.}
operator in the normalized member function call as the
implied object argument~(\ref{over.match.funcs}).

\pnum
In unqualified function calls, the name is not qualified by an
\tcode{->}
or
\tcode{.}
operator and has the more general form of a
\grammarterm{primary-expression}.
The name is looked up in the context of the function
call following the normal rules for name lookup in function
calls~(\ref{basic.lookup}).
The function declarations found by that lookup constitute the
set of candidate functions.
Because of the rules for name lookup, the set of candidate functions
consists (1) entirely of non-member functions or (2) entirely of
member functions of some class
\tcode{T}.
In case (1),
the argument list is
the same as the
\grammarterm{expression-list}
in the call.
In case (2), the argument list is the
\grammarterm{expression-list}
in the call augmented by the addition of an implied object
argument as in a qualified function call.
If the keyword
\tcode{this}~(\ref{class.this}) is in scope and refers to
class
\tcode{T},
or a derived class of
\tcode{T},
then the implied object argument is
\tcode{(*this)}.
If the keyword
\tcode{this}
is not in
scope or refers to another class, then
a contrived object of type
\tcode{T}
becomes the implied object
argument\footnote{An implied object argument must be contrived to
correspond to the implicit object
parameter attributed to member functions during overload resolution.
It is not
used in
the call to the selected function.
Since the member functions all have the
same implicit
object parameter, the contrived object will not be the cause to select or
reject a
function.}.
If the argument list is augmented by a contrived object and overload
resolution selects one of the non-static member functions of
\tcode{T},
the call is ill-formed.

\rSec4[over.call.object]{Call to object of class type}

\pnum
If the
\grammarterm{primary-expression}
\tcode{E}
in the function call syntax evaluates
to a class object of type ``\textit{cv}

\tcode{T}.
The
function call operators of
\tcode{T}
are obtained by ordinary lookup of
the name
\tcode{operator()}
in the context of
\tcode{(E).operator()}.

Similarly, surrogate
call functions are added to the set of candidate functions for
each non-explicit conversion function declared in a base class of
\tcode{T}
provided the function is not hidden within
\tcode{T}
by another
intervening declaration\footnote{Note that this construction can yield
candidate call functions that cannot be
differentiated one from the other by overload resolution because they have
identical
declarations or differ only in their return type.
The call will be ambiguous
if overload
resolution cannot select a match to the call that is uniquely better than such
undifferentiable functions.}.

\pnum
If such a surrogate call function is selected by overload
resolution, the corresponding conversion function will be called to convert
\tcode{E}
to the appropriate function pointer or reference, and the function
will then be invoked with the arguments of the call. If the
conversion function cannot be called (e.g., because of an ambiguity),
the program is ill-formed.

\pnum
The argument list submitted to overload resolution consists of
the argument expressions present in the function call syntax
preceded by the implied object argument
\tcode{(E)}.
\enternote
When comparing the
call against the function call operators, the implied object
argument is compared against the implicit object parameter of the
function call operator.
When comparing the call against a
surrogate call function, the implied object argument is compared
against the first parameter of the surrogate call function.
The
conversion function from which the surrogate call function was
derived will be used in the conversion sequence for that
parameter since it converts the implied object argument to the
appropriate function pointer or reference required by that first
parameter.

In this case, overload resolution is used to determine

three sets of candidate functions, designated

lookup in unqualified function calls~(\ref{basic.lookup.argdep}) except

the unary operator
\tcode{\&},

the built-in candidates set is empty.
For all other operators, the built-in candidates include all

a type match with the left-most parameter of a built-in candidate.

\rSec3[over.best.ics]{Implicit conversion sequences}%
\indextext{overloading!resolution!implicit conversions and|(}

\pnum
An
\term{implicit conversion sequence}
\indextext{sequence!implicit conversion}%
is a sequence of conversions used
to convert an argument in a function call to the type of the
corresponding parameter of the function being called.
The
sequence of conversions is an implicit conversion as defined in
Clause~\ref{conv}, which means it is governed by the rules for
initialization of an object or reference by a single
expression~(\ref{dcl.init}, \ref{dcl.init.ref}).

\pnum
Implicit conversion sequences are concerned only with the type,
cv-qualification, and value category of the argument and how these
are converted to match the corresponding properties of the
parameter.
Other properties, such as the lifetime, storage class,
alignment, or accessibility of the argument and whether or not
the argument is a bit-field are ignored.
So, although an implicit
conversion sequence can be defined for a given argument-parameter
pair, the conversion from the argument to the parameter might still
be ill-formed in the final analysis.

\pnum
A
well-formed implicit conversion
sequence is one of the following forms:

\begin{itemize}
\item
a
\term{standard conversion sequence}~(\ref{over.ics.scs}),
\item
a
\grammarterm{user-defined conversion sequence}~(\ref{over.ics.user}), or
\item
an
\term{ellipsis conversion sequence}~(\ref{over.ics.ellipsis}).
\end{itemize}

\pnum
However, if the target is
\begin{itemize}
\item the first parameter of a constructor or
\item the implicit object parameter of a user-defined conversion function
\end{itemize}
and the constructor or user-defined conversion function is a candidate by
\begin{itemize}
\item \ref{over.match.ctor}, when the argument is the temporary in the second
step of a class copy-initialization,
\item \ref{over.match.copy}, \ref{over.match.conv}, or \ref{over.match.ref}
(in all cases), or
\item the second phase of \ref{over.match.list} when the initializer list
has exactly one element, and the target is the first parameter of a constructor
of class \tcode{X}, and the conversion is to \tcode{X} or reference to
(possibly cv-qualified) \tcode{X},
\end{itemize}
user-defined conversion sequences are not considered.
\enternote
These rules prevent more than one user-defined conversion from being
applied during overload resolution, thereby avoiding infinite recursion.

\pnum
For the case where the parameter type is a reference, see~\ref{over.ics.ref}.

\pnum
When the parameter type is not a reference, the implicit conversion
sequence models a copy-initialization of the parameter from the argument
expression.
The implicit conversion sequence is the one required to convert the
argument expression to a prvalue of the type of
the parameter.
\enternote
When the parameter has a class type, this is a conceptual conversion
defined for the purposes of Clause~\ref{over}; the actual initialization is
defined in terms of constructors and is not a conversion.
\exitnote
Any difference in top-level cv-qualification is
subsumed by the initialization itself and does not constitute a conversion.
\enterexample
a parameter of type
\tcode{A}
can be initialized from an argument of type
\tcode{const A}.
The implicit conversion sequence for that case is the identity sequence; it
contains no ``conversion'' from
\tcode{const A}
to
\tcode{A}.
\exitexample
When the parameter has a class type and the argument expression has the
same type, the implicit conversion sequence is an identity conversion.
When the parameter has a class type and the argument expression has a
derived class type, the implicit conversion sequence is a
derived-to-base
\indextext{conversion!derived-to-base}%
Conversion from the derived class to the base class.
\enternote
There is no such standard conversion; this derived-to-base Conversion exists
only in the description of implicit conversion sequences.
\exitnote
A derived-to-base Conversion has Conversion rank~(\ref{over.ics.scs}).

\pnum
In all contexts, when converting to the implicit object parameter
or when converting to the left operand of an assignment operation
only standard conversion sequences that create no temporary
object for the result are allowed.

\pnum
If no conversions are required to match an argument to a
parameter type, the implicit conversion sequence is the standard
conversion sequence consisting of the identity conversion~(\ref{over.ics.scs}).

\pnum
If no sequence of conversions can be found to convert an argument
to a parameter type or the conversion is otherwise ill-formed, an
implicit conversion sequence cannot be formed.

\pnum
If several different sequences of conversions exist that each
convert the argument to the parameter type, the implicit
conversion sequence associated with the parameter is defined to be
the unique conversion sequence designated the
\term{ambiguous conversion sequence}.
\indextext{sequence!ambiguous conversion}%
For the purpose of ranking implicit conversion sequences as described
in~\ref{over.ics.rank}, the ambiguous conversion sequence is treated
as a user-defined sequence that is indistinguishable from any
other user-defined conversion sequence\footnote{The ambiguous conversion
sequence is ranked with user-defined
conversion sequences because multiple conversion sequences
for an argument can exist only if they involve different
user-defined conversions.  The ambiguous conversion sequence
is indistinguishable from any other user-defined conversion
sequence because it represents at least two user-defined conversion
sequences, each with a different user-defined conversion, and
any other user-defined conversion sequence must be
indistinguishable from at least one of them.

This rule prevents a function from becoming non-viable because of an ambiguous
conversion sequence for one of its parameters.
Consider this example,

\begin{ttfamily}
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{2in}\=\kill%
\indent class B;\\
\indent class A \{ A (B\&);\};\\
\indent class B \{ operator A (); \};\\
\indent class C \{ C (B\&); \};\\
\indent void f(A) \{ \}\\
\indent void f(C) \{ \}\\
\indent B b;\\
\indent f(b);\>\textrm{// ambiguous because \tcode{b} $\to$ \tcode{C} via constructor and}\\
\indent \>\textrm{// \tcode{b} $\to$ \tcode{A} via constructor or conversion function.}
\end{tabbing}
\end{ttfamily}

If it were not for this rule,
\tcode{f(A)}
would be eliminated as a viable
function for the call
\tcode{f(b)}
causing overload resolution to select
\tcode{f(C)}
as the function to call even though it is not clearly the best
choice.
On the other hand, if an
\tcode{f(B)}
were to be declared then
\tcode{f(b)}
would resolve to that
\tcode{f(B)}
because the exact match
with
\tcode{f(B)}
is better than any of the sequences required to match
\tcode{f(A)}.}.
If a function that uses the ambiguous conversion sequence is selected
as the best viable function, the call will be ill-formed because the conversion
of one of the arguments in the call is ambiguous.

\pnum
The three forms of implicit conversion sequences mentioned above
are defined in the following subclauses.

\rSec4[over.ics.scs]{Standard conversion sequences}

\pnum
Table~\ref{tab:over.conversions}
summarizes the conversions defined in Clause~\ref{conv} and
partitions them into four disjoint categories: Lvalue Transformation,
Qualification Adjustment, Promotion, and Conversion.
\enternote
These categories are orthogonal with respect to value category,
cv-qualification, and data representation: the Lvalue Transformations
do not change the cv-qualification or data
representation of the type; the Qualification Adjustments do not
change the value category or data representation of the type; and
the Promotions and Conversions do not change the
value category or cv-qualification of the type.
\exitnote

\pnum
\enternote
As described in Clause~\ref{conv},
a standard conversion sequence is either the Identity conversion
by itself (that is, no conversion) or consists of one to three
conversions from the other
four categories.
At most one conversion from each
category is allowed in a single standard conversion sequence.
If there are two or more conversions in the sequence, the
conversions are applied in the canonical order:
\textbf{Lvalue Transformation},
\textbf{Promotion}
or
\textbf{Conversion},
\textbf{Qualification Adjustment}.
\exitnote

\pnum
\indextext{conversion rank}%
Each conversion in Table~\ref{tab:over.conversions}
also has an associated rank (Exact
Match, Promotion, or Conversion).
These are used
to rank standard conversion sequences~(\ref{over.ics.rank}).
The rank of a conversion sequence is determined by considering the
rank of each conversion in the sequence and the rank of any reference
binding~(\ref{over.ics.ref}).
If any of those has Conversion rank, the
sequence has Conversion rank; otherwise, if any of those has Promotion rank,
the sequence has Promotion rank; otherwise, the sequence has Exact
Match rank.

\rSec4[over.ics.user]{User-defined conversion sequences}

\pnum
A user-defined conversion sequence consists of an initial
standard conversion sequence followed by a user-defined
conversion~(\ref{class.conv}) followed by a second standard
conversion sequence.
If the user-defined conversion is specified
by a constructor~(\ref{class.conv.ctor}), the initial standard
conversion sequence converts the source type to the type required
by the argument of the constructor.
If the user-defined
conversion is specified by a conversion function~(\ref{class.conv.fct}), the
initial standard conversion sequence
converts the source type to the implicit object parameter of the
conversion function.

\pnum
The second standard conversion sequence converts the result of
the user-defined conversion to the target type for the sequence.
Since an implicit conversion sequence is an initialization, the
special rules for initialization by user-defined conversion apply
when selecting the best user-defined conversion for a
user-defined conversion sequence (see~\ref{over.match.best} and~\ref{over.best.ics}).

\pnum
If the user-defined conversion is specified by a
specialization of a conversion function template,
the second standard conversion sequence shall have exact match rank.

\pnum
A conversion of an expression of class type
to the same class type is given Exact Match rank, and
a conversion of an expression of class type
to a base class of that type is given Conversion rank,
in spite of the
fact that a constructor (i.e., a user-defined conversion
function) is called for those cases.

\rSec4[over.ics.ellipsis]{Ellipsis conversion sequences}

\pnum
\indextext{ellipsis!conversion~sequence}%
An ellipsis conversion sequence occurs when an argument in a
function call is matched with the ellipsis parameter
specification of the function called (see~\ref{expr.call}).

\rSec4[over.ics.ref]{Reference binding}

\pnum
When a parameter of reference type binds directly~(\ref{dcl.init.ref}) to an
argument expression, the implicit conversion sequence is the identity conversion,
unless the argument expression has a type that is a derived class of the parameter
type, in which case the implicit conversion sequence is a derived-to-base
Conversion~(\ref{over.best.ics}).
\enterexample

\begin{codeblock}
struct A {};
struct B : public A {} b;
int f(A&);
int f(B&);
int i = f(b);                   // calls \tcode{f(B\&)}, an exact match, rather than
                                // \tcode{f(A\&)}, a conversion
\end{codeblock}
\exitexample
If the parameter binds directly to the result of
applying a conversion function to the argument expression, the implicit
conversion sequence is a user-defined conversion sequence~(\ref{over.ics.user}),
with the second standard conversion sequence either an identity conversion or,
if the conversion function returns an entity of a type that is a derived class
of the parameter type, a derived-to-base Conversion.

\pnum
When a parameter of reference type is not bound directly to an argument
expression, the conversion sequence is the one required to convert the argument
expression to the underlying type of the reference according to~\ref{over.best.ics}.
Conceptually, this conversion sequence corresponds to copy-initializing a
temporary of the underlying type with the argument expression.
Any difference
in top-level cv-qualification is subsumed by the initialization itself and
does not constitute a conversion.

\pnum
Except for an implicit object parameter, for which see~\ref{over.match.funcs}, a
standard conversion sequence cannot be formed if it requires
binding an lvalue reference
other than a reference to a non-volatile \tcode{const} type
to an rvalue
or binding an rvalue reference to an lvalue other than a function lvalue.
\enternote
This means, for example, that a candidate function cannot be a viable
function if it has a non-\tcode{const} lvalue reference parameter (other than
the implicit object parameter) and the corresponding argument is
a temporary or would require one to be created to initialize the lvalue
reference (see~\ref{dcl.init.ref}).
\exitnote

\pnum
Other restrictions on binding a reference to a particular argument
that are not based on the types of the reference and the argument
do not affect the formation of a standard conversion
sequence, however.
\enterexample
a function with an ``lvalue reference to \tcode{int}'' parameter can
be a viable candidate even if the corresponding argument is an
\tcode{int}
bit-field.
The formation of implicit conversion sequences
treats the
\tcode{int}
bit-field as an
\tcode{int}
lvalue and finds an exact
match with the parameter.
If the function is selected by overload
resolution, the call will nonetheless be ill-formed because of
the prohibition on binding a non-\tcode{const} lvalue reference to a bit-field~(\ref{dcl.init.ref}).
\exitexample

\rSec4[over.ics.list]{List-initialization sequence}

\pnum
When an argument is an initializer list~(\ref{dcl.init.list}), it is not an
expression and special rules apply for converting it to a parameter type.

\pnum
If the parameter type is \tcode{std::initializer_list<X>}
and all the elements
of the initializer list can be implicitly converted to \tcode{X}, the implicit
conversion sequence is the worst conversion necessary to convert an element of
the list to \tcode{X}, or if the initializer list has no elements, the identity
conversion. This conversion can be a user-defined conversion even in
the context of a call to an initializer-list constructor. \enterexample
\begin{codeblock}
void f(std::initializer_list<int>);
f( {} );                    // OK: \tcode{f(initializer_list<int>)} identity conversion

f( {'a','b'} );             // OK: \tcode{f(initializer_list<int>)} integral promotion
f( {1.0} );                 // error: narrowing

struct A {
  A(std::initializer_list<double>);           // \#1
  A(std::initializer_list<complex<double>>);  // \#2
  A(std::initializer_list<std::string>);      // \#3

A a{ 1.0,2.0 };             // OK, uses \#1

void g(A);
g({ "foo", "bar" });        // OK, uses \#3

typedef int IA[3];
void h(const IA&);
h({ 1, 2, 3 });             // OK: identity conversion
\end{codeblock}
\exitexample

\pnum
Otherwise, if the parameter type is ``array of \tcode{N} \tcode{X}''\footnote{
Since there are
no parameters of array type, this will only occur as the underlying type of a reference
parameter.}, if the initializer list has exactly \tcode{N} elements or if it has fewer
than \tcode{N} elements and \tcode{X} is default-constructible, and if all the elements
of the initializer list can be implicitly converted to \tcode{X}, the implicit
conversion sequence is the worst conversion necessary to convert an element of the list
to \tcode{X}.

\pnum
Otherwise, if the parameter is a non-aggregate class \tcode{X} and overload
resolution per~\ref{over.match.list} chooses a single best constructor of
\tcode{X} to perform the initialization of an object of type \tcode{X} from the
argument initializer list, the implicit conversion sequence is a user-defined
conversion sequence with the second standard conversion sequence an
identity conversion. If multiple constructors are viable but none is better than
the others, the implicit conversion sequence is the ambiguous conversion
sequence. User-defined conversions are allowed for conversion of the initializer
list elements to the constructor parameter types except as noted
in~\ref{over.best.ics}. \enterexample
\begin{codeblock}
struct A {
  A(std::initializer_list<int>);

\exitexample

\pnum
Otherwise, if the parameter has an aggregate type which can be initialized from
the initializer list according to the rules for aggregate
initialization~(\ref{dcl.init.aggr}), the implicit conversion sequence is a

sequence an identity conversion. \enterexample

\pnum
A use of an overloaded function name without arguments is resolved
in certain contexts to a function, a pointer to function or a pointer to
member function for a specific function from the overload set.
A function template name is considered to name a set of overloaded functions
in such contexts.
The function selected is the one whose type is identical to the
function type of the
target type required in the context.
\enternote
That is, the class of which the function is a member is ignored when matching a
pointer-to-member-function type.
\exitnote
The target can be

\begin{itemize}
\item
an object or reference being initialized~(\ref{dcl.init}, \ref{dcl.init.ref},
\ref{dcl.init.list}),
\item
the left side of an assignment~(\ref{expr.ass}),
\item
a parameter of a function~(\ref{expr.call}),
\item
a parameter of a user-defined operator~(\ref{over.oper}),
\item
the return value of a function, operator function, or conversion~(\ref{stmt.return}),
\item
an explicit type conversion~(\ref{expr.type.conv}, \ref{expr.static.cast},
\ref{expr.cast}), or
\item
a non-type
\grammarterm{template-parameter}~(\ref{temp.arg.nontype}).
\end{itemize}

The overloaded function name can be preceded by the
\tcode{\&}
operator.
An overloaded function name shall not be used without arguments in contexts
other than those listed.
\enternote
Any redundant set of parentheses surrounding the overloaded function name is
ignored~(\ref{expr.prim}).
\exitnote

\pnum
If the name is a function template, template argument deduction is
done~(\ref{temp.deduct.funcaddr}), and if the argument deduction succeeds,
the
resulting template argument list is
used to generate a single
function template specialization,
which is added to the set of overloaded functions
considered.
\enternote
As described in~\ref{temp.arg.explicit}, if deduction fails and the
function template name is followed by an explicit template argument list,
the
\grammarterm{template-id}
is then examined to see whether it identifies a single function template
specialization. If it does, the
\grammarterm{template-id}
is considered to be an lvalue for that function template specialization.
The target type is not used in that determination.
\exitnote

\pnum
Non-member functions and static member functions
match targets of type ``pointer-to-function'' or
``reference-to-function.''
Nonstatic member functions match targets of
type ``pointer-to-member-function''.
If a non-static member function is selected, the reference to the overloaded
function name is required to have the form of a pointer to member as
described in~\ref{expr.unary.op}.

\pnum
If more than one function is selected, any
function template specializations
in the set
are eliminated if the set also contains a function that is not a
function template specialization, and
any given
function template specialization
\tcode{F1}
is eliminated if the set contains a second
function template specialization whose function template
is more specialized than the
function template of
\tcode{F1}
according to
the partial ordering rules of~\ref{temp.func.order}.
After such eliminations,
if any, there shall remain exactly one selected function.

The initialization of
\tcode{pfe}

\pnum
The user-defined function called
\tcode{operator++}
implements the prefix and postfix
\tcode{++}
operator.
If this function is a non-static member function with no parameters, or a non-member
function with one parameter,
it defines the prefix increment operator
\tcode{++}
for objects of that type.
If the function is a non-static member function with one parameter (which shall be of type
\tcode{int})
or a non-member function with two parameters (the second of which shall be of type
\tcode{int}),
it defines the postfix increment operator
\tcode{++}
for objects of that type.
When the postfix increment is called as a result of using the
\tcode{++}
operator, the
\tcode{int}
argument will have value zero.\footnote{Calling
\tcode{operator++}
explicitly, as in expressions like
\tcode{a.operator++(2)},
has no special properties:
The argument to
\tcode{operator++}
is
\tcode{2}.}

A function declared with a \grammarterm{literal-operator-id} is a \term{literal

\enternote Literal operators and literal operator templates are usually invoked
implicitly through user-defined literals~(\ref{lex.ext}). However, except for
the constraints described above, they are ordinary namespace-scope functions and
function templates. In particular, they are looked up like ordinary functions

they can be declared \tcode{inline} or \tcode{constexpr}, they may have internal

\rSec1[over.built]{Built-in operators}%
\indextext{overloading!built-in operators and}

\pnum
The candidate operator functions that represent the built-in operators
defined in Clause~\ref{expr} are specified in this subclause.
These candidate
functions participate in the operator overload resolution process as
described in~\ref{over.match.oper} and are used for no other purpose.
\enternote
Because built-in operators take only operands with non-class type,
and operator overload resolution occurs only when an operand expression
originally has class or enumeration type,
operator overload resolution can resolve to a built-in operator only
when an operand has a class type that has a user-defined conversion to
a non-class type appropriate for the operator, or when an operand has
an enumeration type that can be converted to a type appropriate
for the operator.
Also note that some of the candidate operator functions given in this subclause are
more permissive than the built-in operators themselves.
As
described in~\ref{over.match.oper}, after a built-in operator is selected
by overload resolution the expression is subject to the requirements for
the built-in operator given in Clause~\ref{expr}, and therefore to any
additional semantic constraints given there.
If there is a user-written
candidate with the same name and parameter types as a built-in
candidate operator function, the built-in operator function
is hidden and is not included in the set of candidate functions.

\pnum
In this subclause, the term
\term{promoted integral type}
is used to refer to those integral types which are preserved by
integral promotion (including e.g.
\tcode{int}
and
\tcode{long}
but excluding e.g.
\tcode{char}).
Similarly, the term
\term{promoted arithmetic type}
refers to floating types plus promoted integral types.
\enternote
In all cases where a promoted integral type or promoted arithmetic type is
required, an operand of enumeration type will be acceptable by way of the
integral promotions.
