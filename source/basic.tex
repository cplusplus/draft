\enternote This Clause presents the basic concepts of the \Cpp language.
It explains the difference between an \term{object} and a
\term{name} and how they relate to the value categories for expressions.
It introduces the concepts of a
\term{declaration} and a \term{definition} and presents \Cpp's
notion of \term{type}, \term{scope}, \term{linkage}, and
\term{storage} \term{duration}. The mechanisms for starting and
terminating a program are discussed. Finally, this Clause presents the
\term{fundamental} types of the language and lists the ways of constructing
\term{compound} types from these.\exitnote

part of the language. Such concepts are discussed in the relevant
Clauses. \exitnote

An \defn{entity} is a value, object, reference, function, enumerator, type,
class member, template, template specialization, namespace, parameter
pack, or \tcode{this}.

\pnum
A \defn{name} is a use of an \grammarterm{identifier}~(\ref{lex.name}),
\grammarterm{operator-function-id}~(\ref{over.oper}),
\grammarterm{literal-operator-id}~(\ref{over.literal}),
\grammarterm{conversion-function-id}~(\ref{class.conv.fct}), or
\grammarterm{template-id}~(\ref{temp.names}) that denotes an entity or
\grammarterm{label}~(\ref{stmt.goto}, \ref{stmt.label}).

\pnum
Every name that denotes an entity is introduced by a
\term{declaration}. Every name that denotes a label is introduced
either by a \tcode{goto} statement~(\ref{stmt.goto}) or a
\grammarterm{labeled-statement}~(\ref{stmt.label}).

\pnum
A \defn{variable} is introduced by the
declaration of
a reference other than a non-static data member or of
an object. The variable's name, if any, denotes the reference or object.

\pnum
Some names denote types or templates. In general,
whenever a name is encountered it is necessary to determine whether that name denotes
one of these entities before continuing to parse the program that contains it. The
process that determines this is called
\indextext{lookup!name}%
\term{name lookup}~(\ref{basic.lookup}).

\pnum
Two names are \term{the same} if

\begin{itemize}
\item they are \grammarterm{identifier}{s} composed of the same character sequence, or
\item they are \grammarterm{operator-function-id}{s} formed with
the same operator, or
\item they are \grammarterm{conversion-function-id}{s} formed
with the same type, or
\item they are \grammarterm{template-id}{s} that refer to the same class,
function, or variable~(\ref{temp.type}), or

the same literal suffix identifier.

An expression is \defn{potentially evaluated} unless it is an
unevaluated operand (Clause~\ref{expr}) or a subexpression thereof.
The set of \defn{potential results} of an expression \tcode{e} is
defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{e} is an
\grammarterm{id-expression}~(\ref{expr.prim.general}), the set
contains only \tcode{e}.
\item If \tcode{e} is a class member access
expression~(\ref{expr.ref}), the set contains the potential results of
the object expression.
\item If \tcode{e} is a pointer-to-member
expression~(\ref{expr.mptr.oper}) whose second operand is a constant
expression, the set contains the potential results of the object
expression.
\item If \tcode{e} has the form \tcode{(e1)}, the set contains the
potential results of \tcode{e1}.
\item If \tcode{e} is a glvalue conditional
expression~(\ref{expr.cond}), the set is the union of the sets of
potential results of the second and third operands.
\item If \tcode{e} is a comma expression~(\ref{expr.comma}), the set
contains the potential results of the right operand.
\item Otherwise, the set is empty.
\end{itemize}
\enternote
This set is a (possibly-empty) set of \grammarterm{id-expression}{s},
each of which is either \tcode{e} or a subexpression of \tcode{e}.
\enterexample
In the following example, the set of potential results of the initializer

\pnum
A variable \tcode{x} whose name appears as a
potentially-evaluated expression \tcode{ex} is \defn{odr-used} by \tcode{ex} unless
applying the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (\ref{conv.lval}) to \tcode{x} yields
a constant expression~(\ref{expr.const}) that does not invoke any non-trivial
functions
and, if \tcode{x} is an object, \tcode{ex} is an element of
the set of potential results of an expression \tcode{e}, where either the lvalue-to-rvalue
conversion~(\ref{conv.lval}) is applied to \tcode{e}, or \tcode{e} is
a discarded-value expression~(Clause \ref{expr}).
\tcode{this} is odr-used if it appears as a potentially-evaluated expression
(including as the result of the implicit transformation in the body of a non-static
member function~(\ref{class.mfct.non-static})).
A virtual member
function is odr-used if it is not pure.
A function whose name appears as a potentially-evaluated
expression is odr-used if it is the unique lookup result or the selected
member of a set of overloaded functions~(\ref{basic.lookup}, \ref{over.match}, \ref{over.over}), unless it is a pure virtual
function and its name is not explicitly qualified.
\enternote This covers calls to named
functions~(\ref{expr.call}), operator overloading (Clause~\ref{over}),
user-defined conversions~(\ref{class.conv.fct}), allocation function for
placement new~(\ref{expr.new}), as well as non-default
initialization~(\ref{dcl.init}). A constructor selected to copy or move an
object of class type is odr-used even if the
call is actually elided by the implementation~(\ref{class.copy}). \exitnote An allocation
or deallocation function for a class is odr-used by a new expression
appearing in a potentially-evaluated expression as specified
in~\ref{expr.new} and~\ref{class.free}. A deallocation function for a
class is odr-used by a delete expression appearing in a
potentially-evaluated expression as specified in~\ref{expr.delete}
and~\ref{class.free}. A non-placement allocation or deallocation
function for a class is odr-used by the definition of a constructor of that
class. A non-placement deallocation function for a class is odr-used by the
definition of the destructor of that class, or by being selected by the
lookup at the point of definition of a virtual
destructor~(\ref{class.dtor}).\footnote{An implementation is not required
to call allocation and
deallocation functions from constructors or destructors; however, this
is a permissible implementation technique.}
An assignment operator function in a class is odr-used by an
implicitly-defined
copy-assignment or move-assignment function for another class as specified
in~\ref{class.copy}.
A default constructor for a class is odr-used by
default initialization or value initialization as specified
in~\ref{dcl.init}. A constructor for a class is odr-used as specified
in~\ref{dcl.init}. A destructor for a class is odr-used if it is potentially
invoked~(\ref{class.dtor}).

\pnum
Every program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline
function or variable that is odr-used in that program; no diagnostic required.
The definition can appear explicitly in the program, it can be found in
the standard or a user-defined library, or (when appropriate) it is
implicitly defined (see~\ref{class.ctor}, \ref{class.dtor} and
\ref{class.copy}). An inline function shall be defined in every
translation unit in which it is odr-used.

\pnum
\indextext{type!incomplete}%
Exactly one definition of a class is required in a translation unit if
the class is used in a way that requires the class type to be complete.
\enterexample the following complete translation unit is well-formed,

struct X;                       // declare \tcode{X} as a struct type
struct X* x1;                   // use \tcode{X} in pointer formation
X* x2;                          // use \tcode{X} in pointer formation
\end{codeblock}
\exitexample
\enternote The rules for declarations and expressions
describe in which contexts complete class types are required. A class
type \tcode{T} must be complete if:

\begin{itemize}
\item an object of type \tcode{T} is defined~(\ref{basic.def}), or
\item a non-static class data member of type \tcode{T} is
declared~(\ref{class.mem}), or
\item \tcode{T} is used as the object type or array element type in a
\grammarterm{new-expression}~(\ref{expr.new}), or
\item an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to
a glvalue referring
to an object of type \tcode{T}~(\ref{conv.lval}), or
\item an expression is converted (either implicitly or explicitly) to
type \tcode{T} (Clause~\ref{conv}, \ref{expr.type.conv},
\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}, \ref{expr.static.cast}, \ref{expr.cast}), or
\item an expression that is not a null pointer constant, and has type
other than \term{cv} \tcode{void*}, is converted to the type pointer to \tcode{T}
or reference to \tcode{T} using a standard conversion
(Clause~\ref{conv}), a \tcode{dynamic_cast}~(\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}) or
a \tcode{static_cast}~(\ref{expr.static.cast}), or
\item a class member access operator is applied to an expression of type
\tcode{T}~(\ref{expr.ref}), or
\item the \tcode{typeid} operator~(\ref{expr.typeid}) or the
\tcode{sizeof} operator~(\ref{expr.sizeof}) is applied to an operand of
type \tcode{T}, or
\item a function with a return type or argument type of type \tcode{T}
is defined~(\ref{basic.def}) or called~(\ref{expr.call}), or
\item a class with a base class of type \tcode{T} is
defined (Clause~\ref{class.derived}), or
\item an lvalue of type \tcode{T} is assigned to~(\ref{expr.ass}), or
\item the type \tcode{T} is the subject of an
\tcode{alignof} expression~(\ref{expr.alignof}), or

\tcode{T}, or pointer to \tcode{T}~(\ref{except.handle}).

static data member of a class template~(\ref{temp.static}), member
function of a class template~(\ref{temp.mem.func}), or template
specialization for which some template parameters are not
specified~(\ref{temp.spec}, \ref{temp.class.spec}) in a program provided
that each definition appears in a different translation unit, and
provided the definitions satisfy the following requirements. Given such
an entity named \tcode{D} defined in more than one translation unit,
then
\begin{itemize}
\item each definition of \tcode{D} shall consist of the same sequence of
tokens; and
\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, corresponding names, looked up
according to~\ref{basic.lookup}, shall refer to an entity defined within
the definition of \tcode{D}, or shall refer to the same entity, after
overload resolution~(\ref{over.match}) and after matching of partial
template specialization~(\ref{temp.over}), except that a name can refer
to a non-volatile \tcode{const} object with internal or no linkage if the
object has the same literal type in all definitions of \tcode{D},
and the object is initialized with a constant
expression~(\ref{expr.const}), and the object is not odr-used, and the object
has the same value in all definitions of \tcode{D}; and
\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, corresponding entities shall have the
same language linkage; and
\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, the overloaded operators referred
to, the implicit calls to conversion functions, constructors, operator
new functions and operator delete functions, shall refer to the same
function, or to a function defined within the definition of \tcode{D};
and
\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, a default argument used by an
(implicit or explicit) function call is treated as if its token sequence
were present in the definition of \tcode{D}; that is, the default
argument is subject to the three requirements described above (and, if
the default argument has sub-expressions with default arguments, this
requirement applies recursively).\footnote{\ref{dcl.fct.default} 
describes how default argument names are looked up.}
\item if \tcode{D} is a class with an implicitly-declared
constructor~(\ref{class.ctor}), it is as if the constructor was
implicitly defined in every translation unit where it is odr-used, and the
implicit definition in every translation unit shall call the same
constructor for a base class or a class member of \tcode{D}.

The potential scope of a template parameter name begins at its point of

This also implies that a \grammarterm{template-parameter} can be used in the
specification of base classes. For example,

\begin{codeblock}
template<class T> class X : public Array<T> { /* ... */ };
template<class T> class Y : public T { /* ... */ };

The use of a template parameter as a base class implies that a class used as a template

For each argument type \tcode{T} in the function call, there is a set of
zero or more associated namespaces and a set of zero or more associated
classes to be considered. The sets of namespaces and classes is
determined entirely by the types of the function arguments (and the
namespace of any template template argument). Typedef names and
\grammarterm{using-declaration}{s} used to specify the types do not
contribute to this set. The sets of namespaces and classes are
determined in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{T} is a fundamental type, its associated sets of
namespaces and classes are both empty.

\item If \tcode{T} is a class type (including unions), its associated
classes are: the class itself; the class of which it is a member, if
any; and its direct and indirect base classes. Its associated namespaces
are the innermost enclosing namespaces of its associated classes.
Furthermore, if \tcode{T} is a class template specialization, its
associated namespaces and classes also include: the namespaces and
classes associated with the types of the template arguments provided for
template type parameters (excluding template template parameters); the
namespaces of which any template template arguments are members; and the
classes of which any member templates used as template template
arguments are members. \enternote Non-type template arguments do not
contribute to the set of associated namespaces.\exitnote

\item If \tcode{T} is an enumeration type, its associated namespace is
the innermost enclosing namespace of its declaration. If it is a class member, its
associated class is the member's class; else it has no associated class.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to \tcode{U} or an array of \tcode{U},
its associated namespaces and classes are those associated with
\tcode{U}.

\item If \tcode{T} is a function type, its associated namespaces and
classes are those associated with the function parameter types and those
associated with the return type.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a member function of a class
\tcode{X}, its associated namespaces and classes are those associated
with the function parameter types and return type, together with those
associated with \tcode{X}.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a data member of class \tcode{X}, its
associated namespaces and classes are those associated with the member
type together with those associated with \tcode{X}.

\end{itemize}

If an associated namespace is an inline namespace~(\ref{namespace.def}), its
enclosing namespace is also included in the set. If an associated namespace
directly contains inline namespaces, those inline namespaces are also included
in the set.
In addition, if the argument is the name or address of a set of
overloaded functions and/or function templates, its associated classes
and namespaces are the union of those associated with each of the
members of the set, i.e., the classes and namespaces associated with its
parameter types and return type.
Additionally, if the aforementioned set of overloaded functions is named with
a \grammarterm{template-id}, its associated classes and namespaces also include
those of its type \grammarterm{template-argument}{s} and its template
\grammarterm{template-argument}{s}.

\item it is an unnamed class or enumeration member of a class with linkage; or

template always has external linkage, and the

\enternote In other words, a type without linkage contains a class or enumeration that
cannot be named outside its translation unit. An entity with external linkage declared
using such a type could not correspond to any other entity in another translation unit
of the program and thus must be defined in the
translation unit if it is odr-used. Also note that classes with linkage may contain members

There are two broad classes of named non-local variables: those with static storage
duration~(\ref{basic.stc.static}) and those with thread storage
duration~(\ref{basic.stc.thread}). Non-local variables with static storage duration

thread storage duration are initialized as a consequence of thread execution.
Within each of these phases of initiation, initialization occurs as follows.

Variables with static storage duration~(\ref{basic.stc.static}) or thread storage
duration~(\ref{basic.stc.thread}) shall be zero-initialized~(\ref{dcl.init}) before
any other initialization takes place.
A \term{constant initializer} for an object \tcode{o} is an expression that is a
constant expression, except that it may also invoke \tcode{constexpr} constructors
for \tcode{o} and its subobjects even if those objects are of non-literal class
types \enternote such a class may have a non-trivial destructor \exitnote.
\indextext{initialization!constant}%
\term{Constant initialization} is performed:

\begin{itemize}
\item
if each full-expression (including implicit conversions) that appears in
the initializer of a reference with static or thread storage duration is a
constant expression~(\ref{expr.const}) and the reference is bound to an lvalue
designating an object with static storage duration, to a temporary
(see~\ref{class.temporary}), or to a function;

\item
if an object with static or thread storage duration is initialized
by a constructor call, and if the initialization full-expression is a constant
initializer for the object;

\item
if an object with static or thread storage duration is not initialized by a constructor call
and if either the object is value-initialized or every full-expression that
appears in its initializer is a constant expression.

\end{itemize}

Together, zero-initialization and constant initialization are called \defn{static
initialization}; all other initialization is \defn{dynamic initialization}. Static
initialization shall be performed before any dynamic initialization takes place. Dynamic
initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is either ordered or
unordered. Definitions of explicitly specialized class template static data members have
ordered initialization. Other class template static data members (i.e., implicitly or
explicitly instantiated specializations) have unordered initialization. Other non-local
variables with static storage duration have ordered initialization. Variables with ordered
initialization defined within a single translation unit shall be initialized in the order of
their definitions in the translation unit. If a program starts a thread~(\ref{thread.threads}),
the subsequent initialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to the initialization
of a variable defined in a different translation unit. Otherwise, the initialization of a
variable is indeterminately sequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined
in a different translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent unordered
initialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to every other dynamic initialization.
Otherwise, the unordered initialization of a variable is indeterminately sequenced with respect
to every other dynamic initialization. \enternote This definition permits initialization of a
sequence of ordered variables concurrently with another sequence. \exitnote \enternote The
initialization of local static variables is described in~\ref{stmt.dcl}. \exitnote

\pnum
An implementation is permitted to perform the initialization of a
non-local variable with static storage duration as a static
initialization even if such initialization is not required to be done
statically, provided that

\begin{itemize}
\item
the dynamic version of the initialization does not change the
value of any other object of namespace scope prior to its initialization, and

\item
the static version of the initialization produces the same value
in the initialized variable as would be produced by the dynamic
initialization if all variables not required to be initialized statically
were initialized dynamically.
\end{itemize}

% \item
\enternote As a consequence, if the initialization of an object \tcode{obj1} refers to an
object \tcode{obj2} of namespace scope potentially requiring dynamic initialization and defined
later in the same translation unit, it is unspecified whether the value of \tcode{obj2} used
will be the value of the fully initialized \tcode{obj2} (because \tcode{obj2} was statically
initialized) or will be the value of \tcode{obj2} merely zero-initialized. For example,

\begin{codeblock}
inline double fd() { return 1.0; }
extern double d1;
double d2 = d1;     // unspecified:
                    // may be statically initialized to \tcode{0.0} or

contiguity, and initial value of storage allocated by successive calls
to an allocation function are unspecified. The pointer returned shall be
suitably aligned so that it can be converted to a pointer of any
complete object type with a fundamental alignment requirement~(\ref{basic.align})
and then used to access the object or array in the
storage allocated (until the storage is explicitly deallocated by a call

returned as a request for zero size is undefined.\footnote{The intent is
to have \tcode{operator new()} implementable by

and destruction might not be the same as the behavior of an object whose
lifetime has started and not ended. \ref{class.base.init}

construction and destruction phases. \exitnote

call the destructor explicitly before the storage which the object

\begin{itemize}
\item \term{lvalue reference}
\item \term{rvalue reference}
\end{itemize}

\item \indextext{class}%
\term{classes} containing a sequence of objects of various types
(Clause~\ref{class}), a set of types, enumerations and functions for
manipulating these objects~(\ref{class.mfct}), and a set of restrictions
on the access to these entities (Clause~\ref{class.access});

\term{unions}, which are classes capable of containing objects of
different types at different times,~\ref{class.union};

\pnum
These methods of constructing types can be applied recursively;
restrictions are mentioned in~\ref{dcl.ptr}, \ref{dcl.array},
\ref{dcl.fct}, and~\ref{dcl.ref}. Constructing a type such that the number of
bytes in its object representation exceeds the maximum value representable in
the type \tcode{std::size_t}~(\ref{support.types}) is ill-formed.

\pnum
\indextext{terminology!pointer}%
The type of a pointer to \tcode{void} or a pointer to an object type is
called an \defn{object pointer type}. \enternote A pointer to \tcode{void}
does not have a pointer-to-object type, however, because \tcode{void} is not
an object type. \exitnote The type of a pointer that can designate a function
is called a \defn{function pointer type}.
A pointer to objects of type \tcode{T} is referred to as a ``pointer to
\tcode{T}.'' \enterexample a pointer to an object of type \tcode{int} is
referred to as ``pointer to \tcode{int} '' and a pointer to an object of
class \tcode{X} is called a ``pointer to \tcode{X}.'' \exitexample
Except for pointers to static members, text referring to ``pointers''
does not apply to pointers to members. Pointers to incomplete types are
allowed although there are restrictions on what can be done with
them~(\ref{basic.align}).
\indextext{address}%
A valid value of an object
pointer type represents either the address of a byte in
memory~(\ref{intro.memory}) or a null pointer~(\ref{conv.ptr}). If an
object of type \tcode{T} is located at an address \tcode{A}, a pointer
of type \term{cv} \tcode{T*} whose value is the address \tcode{A} is
said to \term{point to} that object, regardless of how the value was
obtained. \enternote For instance, the address one past the end of an
array~(\ref{expr.add}) would be considered to point to an unrelated
object of the array's element type that might be located at that
address. There are further restrictions on pointers to objects with dynamic storage
duration; see~\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.safety}. \exitnote The value representation of
pointer types is \impldef{value representation of pointer types}. Pointers to
cv-qualified and cv-unqualified
versions~(\ref{basic.type.qualifier}) of layout-compatible types shall
have the same value representation and alignment
requirements~(\ref{basic.align}).
\enternote Pointers to over-aligned types~(\ref{basic.align}) have no special
representation, but their range of valid values is restricted by the extended
alignment requirement. This International Standard specifies only two ways
of obtaining such a pointer: taking the address of a valid object with
an over-aligned type, and using one of the runtime pointer alignment functions.
An implementation may provide other means of obtaining a valid pointer value
for an over-aligned type.\exitnote

\pnum

A pointer to \cv-qualified~(\ref{basic.type.qualifier}) or \cv-unqualified
\tcode{void}
can be used to point to objects of
unknown type. Such a pointer shall be able to hold any object pointer.
An object of type \cv\
\tcode{void*} shall have the same representation and alignment
requirements as \cv\ \tcode{char*}.

A type mentioned in~\ref{basic.fundamental} and~\ref{basic.compound} is
a \term{cv-unqualified type}. Each type which is a
cv-unqualified complete or incomplete object type or is
\tcode{void}~(\ref{basic.types}) has three corresponding cv-qualified
versions of its type: a \grammarterm{const-qualified} version, a
\term{volatile-qualified} version, and a
\term{const-volatile-qualified} version. The term
\term{object type}~(\ref{intro.object}) includes the cv-qualifiers
specified in the \grammarterm{decl-specifier-seq}~(\ref{dcl.spec}), 
\grammarterm{declarator} (Clause~\ref{dcl.decl}),
\grammarterm{type-id}~(\ref{dcl.name}), or 
\grammarterm{new-type-id}~(\ref{expr.new}) when the object is created.

\begin{itemize}
\item A \term{const object} is an object of type \tcode{const T} or a
  non-mutable subobject of such an object.

\item A \term{volatile object} is an object of type
  \tcode{volatile T}, a subobject of such an object, or a mutable
  subobject of a const volatile object.

\item A \term{const volatile object} is an object of type
  \tcode{const volatile T}, a non-mutable subobject of such an object,
  a const subobject of a volatile object, or a non-mutable volatile
  subobject of a const object.

\end{itemize}

The cv-qualified or
cv-unqualified versions of a type
are distinct types; however, they shall have the same representation and
alignment requirements~(\ref{basic.align}).\footnote{The same representation
and alignment requirements are meant to imply
interchangeability as arguments to functions, return values from
functions, and non-static data members of unions.}

\pnum
\indextext{array!\idxcode{const}}%
A compound type~(\ref{basic.compound}) is not cv-qualified by the
cv-qualifiers (if any) of the types from which it is compounded. Any
cv-qualifiers applied to an array type affect the array element type,
not the array type~(\ref{dcl.array}).

\pnum
See~\ref{dcl.fct} and~\ref{class.this} regarding function
types that have \grammarterm{cv-qualifier}{s}.

\pnum
There is a partial ordering on cv-qualifiers, so that a type can be
said to be \grammarterm{more cv-qualified} than another.
Table~\ref{tab:relations.on.const.and.volatile} shows the relations that
constitute this ordering.

\begin{floattable}{Relations on \tcode{const} and \tcode{volatile}}{tab:relations.on.const.and.volatile}

\pnum
In this International Standard, the notation \term{cv} (or
\term{cv1}, \term{cv2}, etc.), used in the description of types,
represents an arbitrary set of cv-qualifiers, i.e., one of
\{\tcode{const}\}, \{\tcode{volatile}\}, \{\tcode{const},
\tcode{volatile}\}, or the empty set. Cv-qualifiers applied to an array
type attach to the underlying element type, so the notation
``\term{cv} \tcode{T},'' where \tcode{T} is an array type, refers to
an array whose elements are so-qualified. An array type whose elements
are cv-qualified is also considered to have the same cv-qualifications
as its elements.%

\rSec1[basic.lval]{Lvalues and rvalues}
\pnum
Expressions are categorized according to the taxonomy in Figure~\ref{fig:categories}.

\begin{importgraphic}
{Expression category taxonomy}
{fig:categories}
{valuecategories.pdf}
\end{importgraphic}

\begin{itemize}
\item An \defn{lvalue} (so called, historically, because lvalues could appear
on the left-hand side of an assignment expression) designates a function or an object.
\enterexample If \tcode{E} is an expression of pointer type, then \tcode{*E} is
an lvalue expression referring to the object or function to which \tcode{E} points.
As another example, the result of calling a function whose return type is an
lvalue reference is an lvalue. \exitexample

\item An \defn{xvalue} (an ``eXpiring'' value) also refers to an object, usually near
the end of its lifetime (so that its resources may be moved, for example). An xvalue
is the result of certain kinds of expressions involving rvalue references~(\ref{dcl.ref}).
\enterexample The result of calling a function whose return type is an rvalue reference
to an object type is an xvalue~(\ref{expr.call}). \exitexample

\item A \defn{glvalue} (``generalized'' lvalue) is an lvalue or an xvalue.

\item An \defn{rvalue} (so called, historically, because rvalues could appear
on the right-hand side of an assignment expression) is an xvalue, a temporary
object~(\ref{class.temporary}) or subobject thereof, or a value that is not
associated with an object.

\item A \defn{prvalue} (``pure'' rvalue) is an rvalue that is not an xvalue.
\enterexample The result of calling a function whose return type is not a reference
is a prvalue. The value of a literal such as \tcode{12}, \tcode{7.3e5}, or \tcode{true}
is also a prvalue. \exitexample
\end{itemize}

Every expression belongs to exactly one of the fundamental classifications in this
taxonomy: lvalue, xvalue, or prvalue. This property of an expression is called
its \defn{value category}. \enternote The discussion of each built-in operator in
Clause~\ref{expr} indicates the category of the value it yields and the value categories
of the operands it expects. For example, the built-in assignment operators expect that
the left operand is an lvalue and that the right operand is a prvalue and yield an
lvalue as the result. User-defined operators are functions, and the categories of
values they expect and yield are determined by their parameter and return types. \exitnote

\pnum
Whenever a glvalue appears in a context where a prvalue is expected, the glvalue is converted
to a prvalue; see~\ref{conv.lval}, \ref{conv.array},
and~\ref{conv.func}.
\enternote
An attempt to bind an rvalue reference to an lvalue is not such a context; see~\ref{dcl.init.ref}.
\exitnote

\pnum
The discussion of reference initialization in~\ref{dcl.init.ref} and of
temporaries in~\ref{class.temporary} indicates the behavior of lvalues
and rvalues in other significant contexts.

\pnum
Unless otherwise indicated~(\ref{expr.call}), prvalues
shall always have complete types or the
\tcode{void} type; in addition to these types, glvalues can also have
incomplete types.
\enternote
class and array prvalues can have cv-qualified types; other prvalues
always have cv-unqualified types. See Clause~\ref{expr}.
\exitnote

\pnum
An lvalue for an object is necessary in order to modify the object
except that an rvalue of class type can also be used to modify its
referent under certain circumstances. \enterexample a member function
called for an object~(\ref{class.mfct}) can modify the object.
\exitexample

\pnum
Functions cannot be modified, but pointers to functions can be
modifiable.

\pnum
A pointer to an incomplete type can be modifiable. At some point in the
program when the pointed to type is complete, the object at which the
pointer points can also be modified.

\pnum
The referent of a \tcode{const}-qualified expression shall not be
modified (through that expression), except that if it is of class type
and has a \tcode{mutable} component, that component can be
modified~(\ref{dcl.type.cv}).

\pnum
If an expression can be used to modify the object to which it refers,
the expression is called \term{modifiable}. A program that attempts
to modify an object through a nonmodifiable lvalue or rvalue expression
is ill-formed.

\pnum
If a program attempts to access the stored value of an object through a glvalue
of other than one of the following types the behavior is
undefined:\footnote{The intent of this list is to specify those circumstances in which an
object may or may not be aliased.}

\begin{itemize}
\item the dynamic type of the object,

\item a cv-qualified version of the dynamic type of the object,

\item a type similar (as defined in~\ref{conv.qual}) to the dynamic type
of the object,

\item a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the
dynamic type of the object,

\item a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to a
cv-qualified version of the dynamic type of the object,

\item an aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned types among its
elements or non-static data members (including, recursively, an element or non-static data member of a
subaggregate or contained union),

\item a type that is a (possibly cv-qualified) base class type of the dynamic type of
the object,

\item a \tcode{char} or \tcode{unsigned} \tcode{char} type.
\end{itemize}

\rSec1[basic.align]{Alignment}

\pnum
\indextext{alignment~requirement!implementation-defined}%
Object types have \term{alignment requirements} (\ref{basic.fundamental},~\ref{basic.compound})
which place restrictions on the addresses at which an object of that type
may be allocated. An \term{alignment} is an \impldef{alignment}
integer value representing the number of bytes between successive addresses
at which a given object can be allocated. An object type imposes an alignment
requirement on every object of that type; stricter alignment can be requested
using the alignment specifier~(\ref{dcl.align}).

\pnum
\indextext{fundamental~alignment}%
\indextext{alignment!fundamental}%
A \term{fundamental alignment} is represented by an alignment
less than or equal to the greatest alignment supported by the implementation in
all contexts, which is equal to
\tcode{alignof(std::max_align_t)}~(\ref{support.types}).
The alignment required for a type might be different when it is used as the type
of a complete object and when it is used as the type of a subobject. \enterexample
\begin{codeblock}
struct B { long double d; };
struct D : virtual B { char c; }
\end{codeblock}

When \tcode{D} is the type of a complete object, it will have a subobject of
type \tcode{B}, so it must be aligned appropriately for a \tcode{long double}.
If \tcode{D} appears as a subobject of another object that also has \tcode{B}
as a virtual base class, the \tcode{B} subobject might be part of a different
subobject, reducing the alignment requirements on the \tcode{D} subobject.
\exitexample The result of the \tcode{alignof} operator reflects the alignment
requirement of the type in the complete-object case.

\pnum
\indextext{extended~alignment}%
\indextext{alignment!extended}%
\indextext{over-aligned~type}%
\indextext{type!over-aligned}%
An \term{extended alignment} is represented by an alignment
greater than \tcode{alignof(std::max_align_t)}. It is implementation-defined
whether any extended alignments are supported and the contexts in which they are
supported~(\ref{dcl.align}). A type having an extended alignment
requirement is an \grammarterm{over-aligned type}. \enternote
every over-aligned type is or contains a class type
to which extended alignment applies (possibly through a non-static data member).
\exitnote

\pnum
Alignments are represented as values of the type \tcode{std::size_t}.
Valid alignments include only those values returned by an \tcode{alignof}
expression for the fundamental types plus an additional \impldef{alignment additional
values}
set of values, which may be empty.
Every alignment value shall be a non-negative integral power of two.

\pnum
Alignments have an order from \term{weaker} to
\term{stronger} or \term{stricter} alignments. Stricter
alignments have larger alignment values. An address that satisfies an alignment
requirement also satisfies any weaker valid alignment requirement.

\pnum
The alignment requirement of a complete type can be queried using an
\tcode{alignof} expression~(\ref{expr.alignof}). Furthermore,
the narrow character types~(\ref{basic.fundamental}) shall have the weakest
alignment requirement.
\enternote This enables the narrow character types to be used as the
underlying type for an aligned memory area~(\ref{dcl.align}).\exitnote

\pnum
Comparing alignments is meaningful and provides the obvious results:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two alignments are equal when their numeric values are equal.
\item Two alignments are different when their numeric values are not equal.
\item When an alignment is larger than another it represents a stricter alignment.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\enternote The runtime pointer alignment function~(\ref{ptr.align})
can be used to obtain an aligned pointer within a buffer; the aligned-storage templates
in the library~(\ref{meta.trans.other}) can be used to obtain aligned storage.
\exitnote

\pnum
If a request for a specific extended alignment in a specific context is not
supported by an implementation, the program is ill-formed. Additionally, a
request for runtime allocation of dynamic storage for which the requested
alignment cannot be honored shall be treated as an allocation failure.
