\rSec2[intro.memory]{Memory model}

\pnum
\indextext{memory model|(}%
The fundamental storage unit in the \Cpp{} memory model is the
\defn{byte}.
A byte is at least large enough to contain
the ordinary literal encoding of any element of the basic
\indextext{character set!basic literal}%
literal character set\iref{lex.charset}
and the eight-bit code units of the Unicode
\indextext{UTF-8}%
UTF-8 encoding form
and is composed of a contiguous sequence of
bits,
\begin{footnote}
The number of bits in a byte is reported by the macro
\tcode{CHAR_BIT} in the header \libheaderref{climits}.
\end{footnote}
the number of which is \impldef{bits in a byte}. The least
significant bit is called the \defn{low-order bit}; the most
significant bit is called the \defn{high-order bit}. The memory
available to a \Cpp{} program consists of one or more sequences of
contiguous bytes. Every byte has a unique address.

\pnum
\begin{note}
The representation of types is described
in~\ref{basic.types.general}.
\end{note}

\pnum
A \defn{memory location} is either an object of scalar type that is not a bit-field
or a maximal sequence of adjacent bit-fields all having nonzero width.
\begin{note}
Various
features of the language, such as references and virtual functions, might
involve additional memory locations that are not accessible to programs but are
managed by the implementation.
\end{note}
Two or more threads of
execution\iref{intro.multithread} can access separate memory
locations without interfering with each other.

\pnum
\begin{note}
Thus a bit-field and an adjacent non-bit-field are in separate memory
locations, and therefore can be concurrently updated by two threads of execution
without interference. The same applies to two bit-fields, if one is declared
inside a nested struct declaration and the other is not, or if the two are
separated by a zero-length bit-field declaration, or if they are separated by a
non-bit-field declaration. It is not safe to concurrently update two bit-fields
in the same struct if all fields between them are also bit-fields of nonzero
width.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{example}
A class declared as
\begin{codeblock}
struct {
  char a;
  int b:5,
  c:11,
  :0,
  d:8;
  struct {int ee:8;} e;
};
\end{codeblock}
contains four separate memory locations: The member \tcode{a} and bit-fields
\tcode{d} and \tcode{e.ee} are each separate memory locations, and can be
modified concurrently without interfering with each other. The bit-fields
\tcode{b} and \tcode{c} together constitute the fourth memory location. The
bit-fields \tcode{b} and \tcode{c} cannot be concurrently modified, but
\tcode{b} and \tcode{a}, for example, can be.

\rSec2[intro.object]{Object model}

\pnum
\indextext{object model|(}%
The constructs in a \Cpp{} program create, destroy, refer to, access, and
manipulate objects.
An \defn{object} is created
by a definition\iref{basic.def},
by a \grammarterm{new-expression}\iref{expr.new},
by an operation that implicitly creates objects (see below),
when implicitly changing the active member of a union\iref{class.union},
or
when a temporary object is created\iref{conv.rval,class.temporary}.
An object occupies a region of storage
in its period of construction\iref{class.cdtor},
throughout its lifetime\iref{basic.life},
and
in its period of destruction\iref{class.cdtor}.
\begin{note}
A function is not an object, regardless of whether or not it
occupies storage in the way that objects do.
\end{note}
The properties of an
object are determined when the object is created. An object can have a
name\iref{basic.link}. An object has a storage
duration\iref{basic.stc} which influences its
lifetime\iref{basic.life}. An object has a
type\iref{basic.types}.
\begin{note}
Some objects are
polymorphic\iref{class.virtual}; the implementation
generates information associated with each such object that makes it
possible to determine that object's type during program execution.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{subobject}%
Objects can contain other objects, called \defnx{subobjects}{subobject}.
A subobject can be
a \defn{member subobject}\iref{class.mem}, a \defn{base class subobject}\iref{class.derived},
or an array element.
\indextext{object!complete}%
An object that is not a subobject of any other object is called a \defn{complete
object}.
If an object is created
in storage associated with a member subobject or array element \placeholder{e}
(which may or may not be within its lifetime),
the created object
is a subobject of \placeholder{e}'s containing object if
\begin{itemize}
\item
the lifetime of \placeholder{e}'s containing object has begun and not ended, and
\item
the storage for the new object exactly overlays the storage location associated with \placeholder{e}, and
\item
the new object is of the same type as \placeholder{e} (ignoring cv-qualification).
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\indextext{object!providing storage for}%
If a complete object is created\iref{expr.new}
in storage associated with another object \placeholder{e}
of type ``array of $N$ \tcode{\keyword{unsigned} \keyword{char}}'' or
of type ``array of $N$ \tcode{std::byte}''\iref{cstddef.syn},
that array \defn{provides storage}
for the created object if
\begin{itemize}
\item
the lifetime of \placeholder{e} has begun and not ended, and
\item
the storage for the new object fits entirely within \placeholder{e}, and
\item
there is no array object that satisfies these constraints nested within \placeholder{e}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
If that portion of the array
previously provided storage for another object,
the lifetime of that object ends
because its storage was reused\iref{basic.life}.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}

\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\indextext{object!nested within}%
An object \placeholder{a} is \defn{nested within} another object \placeholder{b} if
\begin{itemize}
\item
\placeholder{a} is a subobject of \placeholder{b}, or
\item
\placeholder{b} provides storage for \placeholder{a}, or
\item
there exists an object \placeholder{c}
where \placeholder{a} is nested within \placeholder{c},
and \placeholder{c} is nested within \placeholder{b}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
For every object \tcode{x}, there is some object called the
\defn{complete object of} \tcode{x}, determined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
If \tcode{x} is a complete object, then the complete object
of \tcode{x} is itself.

\item
Otherwise, the complete object of \tcode{x} is the complete object
of the (unique) object that contains \tcode{x}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
If a complete object, a member subobject, or an array element is of
class type, its type is considered the \defn{most derived
class}, to distinguish it from the class type of any base class subobject;
an object of a most derived class type or of a non-class type is called a
\defn{most derived object}.

\pnum
A \defn{potentially-overlapping subobject} is either:
\begin{itemize}
\item a base class subobject, or
\item a non-static data member
declared with the \tcode{no_unique_address} attribute\iref{dcl.attr.nouniqueaddr}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\indextext{object!zero size}%
\indextext{object!nonzero size}%
An object has nonzero size if it
\begin{itemize}
\item is not a potentially-overlapping subobject, or
\item is not of class type, or
\item is of a class type with virtual member functions or virtual base classes, or
\item has subobjects of nonzero size or unnamed bit-fields of nonzero length.
\end{itemize}
Otherwise, if the object is a base class subobject
of a standard-layout class type
with no non-static data members,
it has zero size.
Otherwise, the circumstances under which the object has zero size
are \impldef{which non-standard-layout objects
containing no data are considered empty}.
\indextext{most derived object!bit-field}%
Unless it is a bit-field\iref{class.bit},
an object with nonzero size
shall occupy one or more bytes of storage,
including every byte that is occupied in full or in part
by any of its subobjects.
An object of trivially copyable or
standard-layout type\iref{basic.types.general} shall occupy contiguous bytes of
storage.

\pnum
An object is a \defnadj{potentially non-unique}{object} if it is
a string literal object\iref{lex.string},
the backing array of an initializer list\iref{dcl.init.ref}, or
a subobject thereof.

\pnum
\indextext{most derived object!bit-field}%
\indextext{most derived object!zero size subobject}%
Unless an object is a bit-field or a subobject of zero size, the
address of that object is the address of the first byte it occupies.
Two objects
with overlapping lifetimes
that are not bit-fields
may have the same address if
\begin{itemize}
\item one is nested within the other,
\item at least one is a subobject of zero size and they are not of similar types\iref{conv.qual},
or
\item they are both potentially non-unique objects;
\end{itemize}
otherwise, they have distinct addresses
and occupy disjoint bytes of storage.
\begin{footnote}
Under the ``as-if'' rule an
implementation is allowed to store two objects at the same machine address or
not store an object at all if the program cannot observe the
difference\iref{intro.execution}.
\end{footnote}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
static const char test1 = 'x';
static const char test2 = 'x';
const bool b = &test1 != &test2;        // always \tcode{true}

static const char (&r) [] = "x";
static const char *s = "x";
static std::initializer_list<char> il = { 'x' };
const bool b2 = r != il.begin();        // unspecified result
const bool b3 = r != s;                 // unspecified result
const bool b4 = il.begin() != &test1;   // always \tcode{true}
const bool b5 = r != &test1;            // always \tcode{true}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
The address of a non-bit-field subobject of zero size is
the address of an unspecified byte of storage
occupied by the complete object of that subobject.

\pnum
Some operations are described as
\defnx{implicitly creating objects}{object!implicit creation}
within a specified region of storage.
For each operation that is specified as implicitly creating objects,
that operation implicitly creates and starts the lifetime of
zero or more objects of implicit-lifetime types\iref{term.implicit.lifetime.type}
in its specified region of storage
if doing so would result in the program having defined behavior.
If no such set of objects would give the program defined behavior,
the behavior of the program is undefined.
If multiple such sets of objects would give the program defined behavior,
it is unspecified which such set of objects is created.
\begin{note}
Such operations do not start the lifetimes of subobjects of such objects
that are not themselves of implicit-lifetime types.
\end{note}

\pnum
Further, after implicitly creating objects within a specified region of storage,
some operations are described as producing a pointer to a
\defnadj{suitable created}{object}.
These operations select one of the implicitly-created objects
whose address is the address of the start of the region of storage,
and produce a pointer value that points to that object,
if that value would result in the program having defined behavior.
If no such pointer value would give the program defined behavior,
the behavior of the program is undefined.
If multiple such pointer values would give the program defined behavior,
it is unspecified which such pointer value is produced.

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
#include <cstdlib>
struct X { int a, b; };
X *make_x() {
  // The call to \tcode{std::malloc} implicitly creates an object of type \tcode{X}
  // and its subobjects \tcode{a} and \tcode{b}, and returns a pointer to that \tcode{X} object
  // (or an object that is pointer-interconvertible\iref{basic.compound} with it),
  // in order to give the subsequent class member access operations
  // defined behavior.
  X *p = (X*)std::malloc(sizeof(struct X));
  p->a = 1;
  p->b = 2;
  return p;
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
Except during constant evaluation,
an operation that begins the lifetime of
an array of \tcode{unsigned char} or \tcode{std::byte}
implicitly creates objects within the region of storage occupied by the array.
\begin{note}
The array object provides storage for these objects.
\end{note}
Except during constant evaluation,
any implicit or explicit invocation of a function
named \tcode{\keyword{operator} \keyword{new}} or \tcode{\keyword{operator} \keyword{new}[]}
implicitly creates objects in the returned region of storage and
returns a pointer to a suitable created object.
\begin{note}
Some functions in the \Cpp{} standard library implicitly create objects%
\iref{obj.lifetime,c.malloc,mem.res.public,bit.cast,cstring.syn}.
\end{note}
\indextext{object model|)}

\rSec2[basic.align]{Alignment}

\pnum
Object types have \defnx{alignment requirements}{alignment requirement!implementation-defined}\iref{basic.fundamental,basic.compound}
which place restrictions on the addresses at which an object of that type
may be allocated. An \defn{alignment} is an \impldef{alignment}
integer value representing the number of bytes between successive addresses
at which a given object can be allocated. An object type imposes an alignment
requirement on every object of that type; stricter alignment can be requested
using the alignment specifier\iref{dcl.align}.
Attempting to create an object\iref{intro.object} in storage that
does not meet the alignment requirements of the object's type
is undefined behavior.

\pnum
A \defnadj{fundamental}{alignment} is represented by an alignment
less than or equal to the greatest alignment supported by the implementation in
all contexts, which is equal to
\tcode{\keyword{alignof}(std::max_align_t)}\iref{support.types}.
The alignment required for a type may be different when it is used as the type
of a complete object and when it is used as the type of a subobject.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct B { long double d; };
struct D : virtual B { char c; };
\end{codeblock}

When \tcode{D} is the type of a complete object, it will have a subobject of
type \tcode{B}, so it must be aligned appropriately for a \tcode{\keyword{long} \keyword{double}}.
If \tcode{D} appears as a subobject of another object that also has \tcode{B}
as a virtual base class, the \tcode{B} subobject might be part of a different
subobject, reducing the alignment requirements on the \tcode{D} subobject.
\end{example}
The result of the \keyword{alignof} operator reflects the alignment
requirement of the type in the complete-object case.

\pnum
An \defnadj{extended}{alignment} is represented by an alignment
greater than \tcode{\keyword{alignof}(std::max_align_t)}. It is \impldef{support for extended alignments}
whether any extended alignments are supported and the contexts in which they are
supported\iref{dcl.align}. A type having an extended alignment
requirement is an \defnadj{over-aligned}{type}.
\begin{note}
Every over-aligned type is or contains a class type
to which extended alignment applies (possibly through a non-static data member).
\end{note}
A \defnadj{new-extended}{alignment} is represented by
an alignment greater than \mname{STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT}\iref{cpp.predefined}.

\pnum
Alignments are represented as values of the type \tcode{std::size_t}.
Valid alignments include only those values returned by an \keyword{alignof}
expression for the fundamental types plus an additional \impldef{alignment additional
values}
set of values, which may be empty.
Every alignment value shall be a non-negative integral power of two.

\pnum
Alignments have an order from \defnx{weaker}{alignment!weaker} to
\defnx{stronger}{alignment!stronger} or \defnx{stricter}{alignment!stricter} alignments. Stricter
alignments have larger alignment values. An address that satisfies an alignment
requirement also satisfies any weaker valid alignment requirement.

\pnum
The alignment requirement of a complete type can be queried using an
\keyword{alignof} expression\iref{expr.alignof}. Furthermore,
the narrow character types\iref{basic.fundamental} shall have the weakest
alignment requirement.
\begin{note}
This enables the ordinary character types to be used as the
underlying type for an aligned memory area\iref{dcl.align}.
\end{note}

\pnum
Comparing alignments is meaningful and provides the obvious results:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two alignments are equal when their numeric values are equal.
\item Two alignments are different when their numeric values are not equal.
\item When an alignment is larger than another it represents a stricter alignment.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\begin{note}
The runtime pointer alignment function\iref{ptr.align}
can be used to obtain an aligned pointer within a buffer;
an \grammarterm{alignment-specifier}\iref{dcl.align}
can be used to align storage explicitly.
\end{note}

\pnum
If a request for a specific extended alignment in a specific context is not
supported by an implementation, the program is ill-formed.

\rSec2[basic.life]{Lifetime}

\pnum
In this subclause, ``before'' and ``after'' refer to the ``happens before''
relation\iref{intro.multithread}.

\pnum
\indextext{object lifetime|(}%
The \defn{lifetime} of an object or reference is a runtime property of the
object or reference.
A variable is said to have \defnadj{vacuous}{initialization}
if it is default-initialized, no other initialization is performed, and,
if it is of class type or a (possibly multidimensional) array thereof,
a trivial constructor of that class type is selected for
the default-initialization.
The lifetime of an object of type \tcode{T} begins when:
\begin{itemize}
\item storage with the proper alignment and size
  for type \tcode{T} is obtained, and
\item its initialization (if any) is complete
  (including vacuous initialization)\iref{dcl.init},
\end{itemize}
except that if the object is a union member or subobject thereof,
its lifetime only begins if that union member is the
initialized member in the union\iref{dcl.init.aggr,class.base.init},
or as described in
\ref{class.union}, \ref{class.copy.ctor}, and \ref{class.copy.assign},
and except as described in \ref{allocator.members}.
The lifetime of an object \placeholder{o} of type \tcode{T} ends when:
\begin{itemize}
\item if \tcode{T} is a non-class type, the object is destroyed, or
\item if \tcode{T} is a class type, the destructor call starts, or
\item the storage which the object occupies is released,
or is reused by an object that is not nested within \placeholder{o}\iref{intro.object}.
\end{itemize}
When evaluating a \grammarterm{new-expression},
storage is considered reused after it is returned from the allocation function,
but before the evaluation of the \grammarterm{new-initializer}\iref{expr.new}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  int m;
};

void f() {
  S x{1};
  new(&x) S(x.m);   // undefined behavior
}
\end{codeblock}

\pnum
\indextext{reference lifetime}%
The lifetime of a reference begins when its initialization is complete.
The lifetime of a reference ends as if it were a scalar object requiring storage.

\pnum
\begin{note}
\ref{class.base.init}
describes the lifetime of base and member subobjects.
\end{note}

\pnum
The properties ascribed to objects and references throughout this document
apply for a given object or reference only during its lifetime.
\begin{note}
In particular, before the lifetime of an object starts and after its
lifetime ends there are significant restrictions on the use of the
object, as described below, in~\ref{class.base.init}, and
in~\ref{class.cdtor}. Also, the behavior of an object under construction
and destruction can differ from the behavior of an object whose
lifetime has started and not ended. \ref{class.base.init}
and~\ref{class.cdtor} describe the behavior of an object during its periods
of construction and destruction.
\end{note}

\pnum
A program may end the lifetime of an object of class type without invoking the
destructor, by reusing or releasing the storage as described above.
\begin{note}
A \grammarterm{delete-expression}\iref{expr.delete} invokes the destructor
prior to releasing the storage.
\end{note}
In this case, the destructor is not implicitly invoked.
\begin{note}
The correct behavior of a program often depends on
the destructor being invoked for each object of class type.
\end{note}

\pnum
Before the lifetime of an object has started but after the storage which
the object will occupy has been allocated
\begin{footnote}
For example, before the dynamic initialization of
an object with static storage duration\iref{basic.start.dynamic}.

\end{footnote}
or, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage
which the object occupied is reused or released, any pointer that represents the address of
the storage location where the object will be or was located may be
used but only in limited ways.
For an object under construction or destruction, see~\ref{class.cdtor}.
Otherwise, such
a pointer refers to allocated
storage\iref{basic.stc.dynamic.allocation}, and using the pointer as
if the pointer were of type \tcode{\keyword{void}*} is
well-defined. Indirection through such a pointer is permitted but the resulting lvalue may only be used in
limited ways, as described below. The
program has undefined behavior if
\begin{itemize}
\item
  the pointer is used as the operand of a \grammarterm{delete-expression},
\item
  the pointer is used to access a non-static data member or call a
  non-static member function of the object, or
\item
  the pointer is implicitly converted\iref{conv.ptr} to a pointer
  to a virtual base class, or
\item
  the pointer is used as the operand of a
  \keyword{static_cast}\iref{expr.static.cast}, except when the conversion
  is to pointer to \cv{}~\keyword{void}, or to pointer to \cv{}~\keyword{void}
  and subsequently to pointer to
  \cv{}~\keyword{char},
  \cv{}~\tcode{\keyword{unsigned} \keyword{char}}, or
  \cv{}~\tcode{std::byte}\iref{cstddef.syn}, or
\item
  the pointer is used as the operand of a
  \keyword{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
#include <cstdlib>

struct B {
  virtual void f();
  void mutate();
  virtual ~B();

struct D1 : B { void f(); };
struct D2 : B { void f(); };

  void* q = pb;     // OK, \tcode{pb} points to valid memory
  pb->f();          // undefined behavior: lifetime of \tcode{*pb} has ended
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
Similarly, before the lifetime of an object has started but after the
storage which the object will occupy has been allocated or, after the
lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which the object
occupied is reused or released, any glvalue that refers to the original
object may be used but only in limited ways.
For an object under construction or destruction, see~\ref{class.cdtor}.
Otherwise, such
a glvalue refers to
allocated storage\iref{basic.stc.dynamic.allocation}, and using the
properties of the glvalue that do not depend on its value is
well-defined. The program has undefined behavior if
\begin{itemize}
\item the glvalue is used to access the object, or
\item the glvalue is used to call a non-static member function of the object, or
\item the glvalue is bound to a reference to a virtual base class\iref{dcl.init.ref}, or
\item the glvalue is used as the operand of a
\keyword{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast} or as the operand of
\keyword{typeid}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}
Therefore, undefined behavior results
if an object that is being constructed in one thread is referenced from another
thread without adequate synchronization.
\end{note}

\pnum
An object $o_1$ is \defn{transparently replaceable} by an object $o_2$ if
\begin{itemize}
\item the storage that $o_2$ occupies exactly overlays
the storage that $o_1$ occupied, and

\item $o_1$ and $o_2$ are of the same type
(ignoring the top-level cv-qualifiers), and

\item $o_1$ is not a const, complete object, and

\item neither $o_1$ nor $o_2$
is a potentially-overlapping subobject\iref{intro.object}, and

\item either $o_1$ and $o_2$ are both complete objects, or
$o_1$ and $o_2$ are direct subobjects of objects $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively,
and $p_1$ is transparently replaceable by $p_2$.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
After the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which the
object occupied is reused or released, if a new object is created at the
storage location which the original object occupied and the original object was
transparently replaceable by the new object, a pointer that pointed to the
original object, a reference that referred to the original object, or the name
of the original object will automatically refer to the new object and, once the
lifetime of the new object has started, can be used to manipulate the new
object.

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}

first parameter shall not have an associated default
argument\iref{dcl.fct.default}. The value of the first parameter
is interpreted as the requested size of the allocation. An allocation
function can be a function template. Such a template shall declare its
return type and first parameter as specified above (that is, template
parameter types shall not be used in the return type and first parameter
type). Allocation function templates shall have two or more parameters.

\pnum
An allocation function attempts to allocate the requested amount of
storage. If it is successful, it returns the address of the start
of a block of storage whose length in bytes is at least as large
as the requested size.
The order,
contiguity, and initial value of storage allocated by successive calls
to an allocation function are unspecified.
Even if the size of the space
requested is zero, the request can fail. If the request succeeds, the
value returned by a replaceable allocation function
is a non-null pointer value\iref{basic.compound}
\tcode{p0} different from any previously returned value \tcode{p1},
unless that value \tcode{p1} was subsequently passed to a
replaceable deallocation function.
Furthermore, for the library allocation functions
in~\ref{new.delete.single} and~\ref{new.delete.array},
\tcode{p0} represents the address of a block of storage disjoint from the storage
for any other object accessible to the caller.
The effect of indirecting through a pointer
returned from a request for zero size is undefined.
\begin{footnote}
The intent is
to have \tcode{\keyword{operator} \keyword{new}()} implementable by
calling \tcode{std::malloc()} or \tcode{std::calloc()}, so the rules are
substantially the same. \Cpp{} differs from C in requiring a zero request
to return a non-null pointer.

a reserved placement allocation function\iref{new.delete.placement},
the pointer returned on a successful call
shall represent the address of storage that is aligned as follows:

  If the allocation function takes an argument
  of type \tcode{std::align_val_t},
  the storage will have the alignment specified
  by the value of this argument.
\item
  Otherwise, if the allocation function is named \tcode{\keyword{operator} \keyword{new}[]},
  the storage is aligned for any object that
  does not have new-extended alignment\iref{basic.align} and

An allocation function that has a non-throwing

sequenced before the construction of the next array element, if any.

\pnum
The third context is when a reference binds to a temporary object.
\begin{footnote}
The same rules apply to initialization of an
  \tcode{initializer_list} object\iref{dcl.init.list} with its
  underlying temporary array.
\end{footnote}
The temporary object to which the reference is bound or the temporary object
that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound
persists for the lifetime of the reference if the glvalue
to which the reference is bound
was obtained through one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  a temporary materialization conversion\iref{conv.rval},
\item
  \tcode{(} \grammarterm{expression} \tcode{)},
  where \grammarterm{expression} is one of these expressions,
\item
  subscripting\iref{expr.sub} of an array operand,
  where that operand is one of these expressions,
\item
  a class member access\iref{expr.ref} using the \tcode{.} operator
  where the left operand is one of these expressions and
  the right operand designates a non-static data member of non-reference type,
\item
  a pointer-to-member operation\iref{expr.mptr.oper} using the \tcode{.*} operator
  where the left operand is one of these expressions and
  the right operand is a pointer to data member of non-reference type,
\item
  a
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \keyword{const_cast}\iref{expr.const.cast},
  \item \keyword{static_cast}\iref{expr.static.cast},
  \item \keyword{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast}, or
  \item \keyword{reinterpret_cast}\iref{expr.reinterpret.cast}
  \end{itemize}
  converting, without a user-defined conversion,
  a glvalue operand that is one of these expressions
  to a glvalue that refers
  to the object designated by the operand, or
  to its complete object or a subobject thereof,
\item
  a conditional expression\iref{expr.cond} that is a glvalue
  where the second or third operand is one of these expressions, or
\item
  a comma expression\iref{expr.comma} that is a glvalue
  where the right operand is one of these expressions.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T> using id = T;

int i = 1;
int&& a = id<int[3]>{1, 2, 3}[i];           // temporary array has same lifetime as \tcode{a}
const int& b = static_cast<const int&>(0);  // temporary \tcode{int} has same lifetime as \tcode{b}
int&& c = cond ? id<int[3]>{1, 2, 3}[i] : static_cast<int&&>(0);
                                            // exactly one of the two temporaries is lifetime-extended
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
An explicit type conversion\iref{expr.type.conv,expr.cast}
is interpreted as
a sequence of elementary casts,
covered above.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
const int& x = (const int&)1;   // temporary for value 1 has same lifetime as x
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{note}
\begin{note}
If a temporary object has a reference member initialized by another temporary object,
lifetime extension applies recursively to such a member's initializer.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  const int& m;
};
const S& s = S{1};              // both \tcode{S} and \tcode{int} temporaries have lifetime of \tcode{s}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{note}

The exceptions to this lifetime rule are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A temporary object bound to a reference parameter in a function call\iref{expr.call}
persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the call.

\item A temporary object bound to a reference element of
an aggregate of class type initialized from
a parenthesized \grammarterm{expression-list}\iref{dcl.init}
persists until the completion of the full-expression
containing the \grammarterm{expression-list}.

\item A temporary bound to a reference in a \grammarterm{new-initializer}\iref{expr.new} persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the \grammarterm{new-initializer}.
\begin{note}
This might introduce a dangling reference.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S { int mi; const std::pair<int,int>& mp; };
S a { 1, {2,3} };
S* p = new S{ 1, {2,3} };       // creates dangling reference
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The fourth context is when a temporary object
is created in the \grammarterm{for-range-initializer} of a range-based \keyword{for} statement.
If such a temporary object would otherwise be destroyed
at the end of the \grammarterm{for-range-initializer} full-expression,
the object persists for the lifetime of the reference
initialized by the \grammarterm{for-range-initializer}.

\pnum
The fifth context is when a temporary object
is created in a structured binding declaration\iref{dcl.struct.bind}.
Any temporary objects introduced by
the \grammarterm{initializer}{s} for the variables
with unique names
are destroyed at the end of the structured binding declaration.

\pnum
Let \tcode{x} and \tcode{y} each be either
a temporary object whose lifetime is not extended, or
a function parameter.
If the lifetimes of \tcode{x} and \tcode{y} end at
the end of the same full-expression, and
\tcode{x} is initialized before \tcode{y}, then
the destruction of \tcode{y} is sequenced before that of \tcode{x}.
If the lifetime of two or more temporaries
with lifetimes extending beyond the full-expressions in which they were created
ends at the same point,
these temporaries are destroyed at that point in the reverse order of the
completion of their construction.
In addition, the destruction of such temporaries shall
take into account the ordering of destruction of objects with static, thread, or
automatic storage duration\iref{basic.stc.static,basic.stc.thread,basic.stc.auto};
that is, if
\tcode{obj1}
is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created before the temporary is created
the temporary shall be destroyed before
\tcode{obj1}
is destroyed;
if
\tcode{obj2}
is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created after the temporary is created
the temporary shall be destroyed after
\tcode{obj2}
is destroyed.

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  S();
  S(int);
  friend S operator+(const S&, const S&);
  ~S();
};
S obj1;
const S& cr = S(16)+S(23);
S obj2;
\end{codeblock}

The expression
\tcode{S(16) + S(23)}
creates three temporaries:
a first temporary
\tcode{T1}
to hold the result of the expression
\tcode{S(16)},
a second temporary
\tcode{T2}
to hold the result of the expression
\tcode{S(23)},
and a third temporary
\tcode{T3}
to hold the result of the addition of these two expressions.
The temporary
\tcode{T3}
is then bound to the reference
\tcode{cr}.
It is unspecified whether
\tcode{T1}
or
\tcode{T2}
is created first.
On an implementation where
\tcode{T1}
is created before
\tcode{T2},
\tcode{T2}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{T1}.
The temporaries
\tcode{T1}
and
\tcode{T2}
are bound to the reference parameters of
\tcode{\keyword{operator}+};
these temporaries are destroyed at the end of the full-expression
containing the call to
\tcode{\keyword{operator}+}.
The temporary
\tcode{T3}
bound to the reference
\tcode{cr}
is destroyed at the end of
\tcode{cr}'s
lifetime, that is, at the end of the program.
In addition, the order in which
\tcode{T3}
is destroyed takes into account the destruction order of other objects with
static storage duration.
That is, because
\tcode{obj1}
is constructed before
\tcode{T3},
and
\tcode{T3}
is constructed before
\tcode{obj2},
\tcode{obj2}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{T3},
and
\tcode{T3}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{obj1}.

The type of a pointer that can designate a function

A pointer to an object of type \tcode{T} is referred to as a ``pointer to

\begin{example}
A pointer to an object of type \keyword{int} is

For an object that is not within its lifetime,
this is the first byte in memory that it will occupy or used to occupy.
\end{footnote}
or the first byte in memory
after the end of the storage occupied by the object,
respectively.
\begin{note}
A pointer past the end of an object\iref{expr.add}
is not considered to point to an unrelated object
of the object's type,
even if the unrelated object is located at that address.
\end{note}
For purposes of pointer arithmetic\iref{expr.add}
and comparison\iref{expr.rel,expr.eq},
a pointer past the end of the last element of
an array \tcode{x} of $n$ elements
is considered to be equivalent to
a pointer to a hypothetical array element $n$ of \tcode{x} and
an object of type \tcode{T} that is not an array element
is considered to belong to an array with one element of type \tcode{T}.
The value representation of
pointer types is \impldef{value representation of pointer types}. Pointers to
layout-compatible types shall
have the same value representation and alignment
requirements\iref{basic.align}.

The \defn{lookup set} for a name $N$ in a class or class template $C$, called $S(N,C)$,
consists of two component sets:
the \term{declaration set}, a set of members named $N$; and
the \term{subobject set},
a set of subobjects where declarations of these members were found
(possibly via \grammarterm{using-declaration}{s}).
In the declaration set, type declarations (including injected-class-names)
are replaced by the types they designate. $S(N,C)$ is calculated as follows:

\pnum
The declaration set is the result of
a single search in the scope of $C$ for $N$
from immediately after the \grammarterm{class-specifier} of $C$
if $P$ is in a complete-class context of $C$ or
from $P$ otherwise.
If the resulting declaration set is not empty, the subobject set
contains $C$ itself, and calculation is complete.

\pnum
Otherwise (i.e., $C$ does not contain a declaration of $N$
or the resulting declaration set is empty), $S(N,C)$ is initially empty.
Calculate the lookup set for $N$
in each direct non-dependent\iref{temp.dep.type} base class subobject $B_i$, and
merge each such lookup set $S(N,B_i)$ in turn into $S(N,C)$.
\begin{note}
If $C$ is incomplete,
only base classes whose \grammarterm{base-specifier} appears before $P$
are considered.
If $C$ is an instantiated class, its base classes are not dependent.
\end{note}

\pnum
The following steps define the result of merging lookup set $S(N,B_i)$
into the intermediate $S(N,C)$:

\begin{itemize}
\item If each of the subobject members of $S(N,B_i)$ is a base class
subobject of at least one of the subobject members of $S(N,C)$, or if
$S(N,B_i)$ is empty, $S(N,C)$ is unchanged and the merge is complete.
Conversely, if each of the subobject members of $S(N,C)$ is a base class
subobject of at least one of the subobject members of $S(N,B_i)$, or if
$S(N,C)$ is empty, the new $S(N,C)$ is a copy of $S(N,B_i)$.

\item Otherwise, if the declaration sets of $S(N,B_i)$ and $S(N,C)$
differ, the merge is ambiguous: the new $S(N,C)$ is a lookup set with an
invalid declaration set and the union of the subobject sets. In
subsequent merges, an invalid declaration set is considered different
from any other.

\item Otherwise, the new $S(N,C)$ is a lookup set with the shared set of
declarations and the union of the subobject sets.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The result of the search is the declaration set of $S(M,T)$.
If it is an invalid set, the program is ill-formed.
If it differs from the result of a search in $T$ for $M$
in a complete-class context\iref{class.mem} of $T$,
the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A { int x; };                    // S(x,A) = \{ \{ \tcode{A::x} \}, \{ \tcode{A} \} \}

struct D: public virtual C { };         // S(x,D) = S(x,C)
struct E: public virtual C { char x; }; // S(x,E) = \{ \{ \tcode{E::x} \}, \{ \tcode{E} \} \}

  f.x = 0;                              // OK, lookup finds \tcode{E::x}
}
\end{codeblock}

$S(\tcode{x},\tcode{F})$ is unambiguous because the \tcode{A} and \tcode{B} base
class subobjects of \tcode{D} are also base class subobjects of \tcode{E}, so
$S(\tcode{x},\tcode{D})$ is discarded in the first merge step.
\end{example}

\pnum
If $M$ is a non-dependent \grammarterm{conversion-function-id},
conversion function templates that are members of $T$ are considered.
For each such template $F$, the lookup set $S(t,T)$ is constructed,
considering a function template declaration to have the name $t$
only if it corresponds to a declaration of $F$\iref{basic.scope.scope}.
The members of the declaration set of each such lookup set,
which shall not be an invalid set, are included in the result.

Overload resolution will discard those
that cannot convert to the type specified by $M$\iref{temp.over}.

  template <class T> int h(T);

int x = f<N::A>(N::A());        // OK, lookup of \tcode{f} finds nothing, \tcode{f} treated as template name
int y = g<N::A>(N::A());        // OK, lookup of \tcode{g} finds a function, \tcode{g} treated as template name
int z = h<N::A>(N::A());        // error: \tcode{h<} does not begin a \grammarterm{template-id}
\end{codeblock}

The rules have no effect on the syntactic interpretation of an expression.
For example,
\begin{codeblock}
typedef int f;
namespace N {
  struct A {
    friend void f(A &);
    operator int();
    void g(A a) {
      int i = f(a);             // \tcode{f} is the typedef, not the friend function: equivalent to \tcode{int(a)}
    }
  };
}
\end{codeblock}
Because the expression is not a function call,
argument-dependent name lookup does not apply and
the friend function \tcode{f} is not found.
\end{note}

\pnum
For each argument type \tcode{T} in the function call,
there is a set of zero or more \defnx{associated entities}{entity!associated}
to be considered.
The set of entities is determined entirely by
the types of the function arguments
(and any template template arguments).
Any \grammarterm{typedef-name}s and \grammarterm{using-declaration}{s}
used to specify the types
do not contribute to this set.
The set of entities
is determined in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{T} is a fundamental type, its associated set of
entities is empty.

\item If \tcode{T} is a class type (including unions),
its associated entities are:
the class itself;
the class of which it is a member, if any;
and, if it is a complete type, its direct and indirect base classes.
Furthermore, if \tcode{T} is a class template specialization,
its associated entities also include:
the entities
associated with the types of the template arguments
provided for template type parameters;
the templates used as template template arguments; and
the classes of which any member templates used as template template
arguments are members.
\begin{note}
Non-type template arguments do not
contribute to the set of associated entities.
\end{note}

\item If \tcode{T} is an enumeration type,
its associated entities are \tcode{T}
and, if it is a class member, the member's class.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to \tcode{U} or an array of \tcode{U},
its associated entities are those associated with \tcode{U}.

\item If \tcode{T} is a function type, its associated
entities are those associated with the function parameter types and those
associated with the return type.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a member function of a class
\tcode{X}, its associated entities are those associated
with the function parameter types and return type, together with those
associated with \tcode{X}.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a data member of class \tcode{X}, its
associated entities are those associated with the member
type together with those associated with \tcode{X}.
\end{itemize}
In addition, if the argument is an overload set or the address of such a set,
its associated entities
are the union of those associated with each of the
members of the set, i.e., the entities associated with its
parameter types and return type.
Additionally, if the aforementioned overload set is named with
a \grammarterm{template-id}, its associated entities also include
its template \grammarterm{template-argument}{s} and
those associated with its type \grammarterm{template-argument}s.

\pnum
The \term{associated namespaces} for a call are
the innermost enclosing non-inline namespaces for its associated entities
as well as every element of the inline namespace set\iref{namespace.def}
of those namespaces.
Argument-dependent lookup finds
all declarations of functions and function templates that
\begin{itemize}
\item
are found by a search of any associated namespace, or
\item
are declared as a friend\iref{class.friend} of any class
with a reachable definition in the set of associated entities, or
\item
are exported,
are attached to a named module \tcode{M}\iref{module.interface},
do not appear in the translation unit containing the point of the lookup, and
have the same innermost enclosing non-inline namespace scope as
a declaration of an associated entity attached to \tcode{M}\iref{basic.link}.
\end{itemize}
If the lookup is for a dependent name\iref{temp.dep,temp.dep.candidate},
the above lookup is also performed
from each point in the instantiation context\iref{module.context} of the lookup,
additionally ignoring any declaration that
appears in another translation unit,
is attached to the global module, and
is either discarded\iref{module.global.frag} or has internal linkage.

\pnum
Every program shall contain at least one definition of every
function or variable that is odr-used in that program
outside of a discarded statement\iref{stmt.if}; no diagnostic required.
The definition can appear explicitly in the program, it can be found in
the standard or a user-defined library, or (when appropriate) it is
implicitly defined (see~\ref{class.default.ctor}, \ref{class.copy.ctor},
\ref{class.dtor}, and \ref{class.copy.assign}).
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
auto f() {
  struct A {};
  return A{};
}
decltype(f()) g();
auto x = g();
\end{codeblock}
A program containing this translation unit is ill-formed
because \tcode{g} is odr-used but not defined,
and cannot be defined in any other translation unit
because the local class \tcode{A} cannot be named outside this
translation unit.

\begin{codeblock}

\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
The rules for declarations and expressions
describe in which contexts complete class types are required. A class
type \tcode{T} must be complete if
\begin{itemize}
\item an object of type \tcode{T} is defined\iref{basic.def}, or
\item a function with a return type or argument type of type \tcode{T}
is defined\iref{basic.def} or called\iref{expr.call}, or
\item the type \tcode{T} is the subject of an
\keyword{alignof} expression\iref{expr.alignof}, or
\item \tcode{T} is used as the allocated type or array element type in a
\grammarterm{new-expression}\iref{expr.new}, or
\item an expression is converted (either implicitly or explicitly) to
type \tcode{T}\iref{conv,expr.type.conv,
expr.dynamic.cast,expr.static.cast,expr.cast}, or
\item an expression that is not a null pointer constant, and has type
other than \cv{}~\tcode{\keyword{void}*}, is converted to the type pointer to \tcode{T}
or reference to \tcode{T} using a standard conversion\iref{conv},
a \keyword{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast} or
a \keyword{static_cast}\iref{expr.static.cast}, or
\item an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to
a glvalue referring
to an object of type \tcode{T}\iref{conv.lval}, or
\item a class member access operator is applied to an expression of type
\tcode{T}\iref{expr.ref}, or
\item the \keyword{typeid} operator\iref{expr.typeid} or the
\keyword{sizeof} operator\iref{expr.sizeof} is applied to an operand of
type \tcode{T}, or
\item an lvalue of type \tcode{T} is assigned to\iref{expr.ass}, or

\pnum
For any definable item \tcode{D} with definitions in multiple translation units,
\begin{itemize}
\item
if \tcode{D} is a non-inline non-templated function or variable, or
\item
if the definitions in different translation units
do not satisfy the following requirements,
\end{itemize}
the program is ill-formed;
a diagnostic is required only
if the definable item is attached to a named module and
a prior definition is reachable at the point where a later definition occurs.
Given such an item,
for all definitions of \tcode{D}, or,
if \tcode{D} is an unnamed enumeration,
for all definitions of \tcode{D} that are reachable at any given program point,
the following requirements shall be satisfied.
\begin{itemize}
\item Each such definition
shall not be attached to a named module\iref{module.unit}.
\item Each such definition shall consist of
the same sequence of tokens,
where the definition of a closure type
is considered to consist of the sequence of tokens of
the corresponding \grammarterm{lambda-expression}.
\item In each such definition, corresponding names, looked up
according to~\ref{basic.lookup}, shall refer to the same entity, after
overload resolution\iref{over.match} and after matching of partial
template specialization\iref{temp.over}, except that a name can refer to
\begin{itemize}
\item
a non-volatile const object with internal or no linkage if the object
\begin{itemize}
\item has the same literal type in all definitions of \tcode{D},
\item is initialized with a constant expression\iref{expr.const},
\item is not odr-used in any definition of \tcode{D}, and
\item has the same value in all definitions of \tcode{D},
\end{itemize}
or
\item
a reference with internal or no linkage
initialized with a constant expression such that
the reference refers to the same entity in all definitions of \tcode{D}.
\end{itemize}

\item In each such definition, except within
the default arguments and default template arguments of \tcode{D},
corresponding \grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s} shall have
the same closure type (see below).

\item In each such definition, corresponding entities shall have the
same language linkage.

\item In each such definition,
const objects with static or thread storage duration
shall be constant-initialized if
the object is constant-initialized in any such definition.

\item In each such definition,
corresponding manifestly constant-evaluated expressions
that are not value-dependent
shall have the same value\iref{expr.const,temp.dep.constexpr}.

\item In each such definition, the overloaded operators referred
to, the implicit calls to conversion functions, constructors, operator
new functions and operator delete functions, shall refer to the same
function.

\item In each such definition,
a default argument used by an (implicit or explicit) function call or
a default template argument used by an (implicit or explicit)
\grammarterm{template-id} or \grammarterm{simple-template-id}
is treated as if its token sequence
were present in the definition of \tcode{D};
that is, the default argument or default template argument
is subject to the requirements described in this paragraph (recursively).
\end{itemize}

\pnum
For the purposes of the preceding requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{D} is a class with an implicitly-declared
constructor\iref{class.default.ctor,class.copy.ctor},
it is as if the constructor was
implicitly defined in every translation unit where it is odr-used, and the
implicit definition in every translation unit shall call the same
constructor for a subobject of \tcode{D}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
// translation unit 1:
struct X {
  X(int, int);
  X(int, int, int);
};
X::X(int, int = 0) { }
class D {
  X x = 0;
};
D d1;                           // \tcode{X(int, int)} called by \tcode{D()}

// translation unit 2:
struct X {
  X(int, int);
  X(int, int, int);
};
X::X(int, int = 0, int = 0) { }
class D {
  X x = 0;
};
D d2;                           // \tcode{X(int, int, int)} called by \tcode{D()};
                                // \tcode{D()}'s implicit definition violates the ODR
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\item If \tcode{D} is a class with
a defaulted three-way comparison operator function\iref{class.spaceship},
it is as if the operator was
implicitly defined in every translation unit where it is odr-used, and the
implicit definition in every translation unit shall call the same
comparison operators for each subobject of \tcode{D}.

\item
If \tcode{D} is a template and is defined in more than one
translation unit, the requirements
apply both to names from the template's enclosing scope used in the
template definition, and also to dependent names at
the point of instantiation\iref{temp.dep}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
These requirements also apply to corresponding entities
defined within each definition of \tcode{D}
(including the closure types of \grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s},
but excluding entities defined within default arguments or
default template arguments of either \tcode{D} or
an entity not defined within \tcode{D}).
For each such entity and for \tcode{D} itself,
the behavior is as if there is a single entity with a single definition,
including in the application of these requirements to other entities.
\begin{note}
The entity is still declared in multiple translation units, and \ref{basic.link}
still applies to these declarations. In particular,
\grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s}\iref{expr.prim.lambda}
appearing in the type of \tcode{D} can result
in the different declarations having distinct types, and
\grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s} appearing in a default argument of \tcode{D}
might still denote different types in different translation units.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
inline void f(bool cond, void (*p)()) {
  if (cond) f(false, []{});
}
inline void g(bool cond, void (*p)() = []{}) {
  if (cond) g(false);
}
struct X {
  void h(bool cond, void (*p)() = []{}) {
    if (cond) h(false);
  }
};
\end{codeblock}

If the definition of \tcode{f} appears in multiple translation units,
the behavior of the program is as if
there is only one definition of \tcode{f}.
If the definition of \tcode{g} appears in multiple translation units,
the program is ill-formed (no diagnostic required) because
each such definition uses a default argument that
refers to a distinct \grammarterm{lambda-expression} closure type.
The definition of \tcode{X} can appear
in multiple translation units of a valid program;
the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s} defined within
the default argument of \tcode{X::h} within the definition of \tcode{X}
denote the same closure type in each translation unit.
\end{example}

\pnum
If, at any point in the program,
there is more than one
reachable unnamed enumeration definition in the same scope
that have the same first enumerator name and
do not have typedef names for linkage purposes\iref{dcl.enum},
those unnamed enumeration types shall be the same; no diagnostic required.
