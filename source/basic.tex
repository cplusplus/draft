\gramSec[gram.basic]{Basic concepts}

\pnum
\begin{note} This Clause presents the basic concepts of the \Cpp language.
It explains the difference between an object and a
name and how they relate to the value categories for expressions.
It introduces the concepts of a
declaration and a definition and presents \Cpp's
notion of type, scope, linkage, and
storage duration. The mechanisms for starting and
terminating a program are discussed. Finally, this Clause presents the
fundamental types of the language and lists the ways of constructing
compound types from these.\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note} This Clause does not cover concepts that affect only a single
part of the language. Such concepts are discussed in the relevant
Clauses. \end{note}

\indextext{region!declarative}%
An \defn{entity} is a value, object, reference, function, enumerator, type,
class member, bit-field, template, template specialization, namespace, or
parameter pack.

\pnum
A \defn{name} is a use of an \grammarterm{identifier}~(\ref{lex.name}),
\grammarterm{operator-function-id}~(\ref{over.oper}),
\grammarterm{literal-operator-id}~(\ref{over.literal}),
\grammarterm{conversion-function-id}~(\ref{class.conv.fct}), or
\grammarterm{template-id}~(\ref{temp.names}) that denotes an entity or
\grammarterm{label}~(\ref{stmt.goto}, \ref{stmt.label}).

\pnum
Every name that denotes an entity is introduced by a
\defn{declaration}. Every name that denotes a label is introduced
either by a \tcode{goto} statement~(\ref{stmt.goto}) or a
\grammarterm{labeled-statement}~(\ref{stmt.label}).

\pnum
A \defn{variable} is introduced by the
declaration of
a reference other than a non-static data member or of
an object. The variable's name, if any, denotes the reference or object.

\pnum
Some names denote types or templates. In general,
whenever a name is encountered it is necessary to determine whether that name denotes
one of these entities before continuing to parse the program that contains it. The
process that determines this is called
\defnx{name lookup}{lookup!name}~(\ref{basic.lookup}).

\pnum
Two names are \defnx{the same}{name!same} if
\begin{itemize}
\item they are \grammarterm{identifier}{s} composed of the same character sequence, or
\item they are \grammarterm{operator-function-id}{s} formed with
the same operator, or
\item they are \grammarterm{conversion-function-id}{s} formed
with the same type, or
\item they are \grammarterm{template-id}{s} that refer to the same class,
function, or variable~(\ref{temp.type}), or
\item they are the names of literal operators~(\ref{over.literal}) formed with
the same literal suffix identifier.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\indextext{translation unit!name and}%
\indextext{linkage}%
A name used in more than one translation unit can potentially
refer to the same entity in these translation units depending on the
linkage~(\ref{basic.link}) of the name specified in each
translation unit.

\rSec1[basic.def]{Declarations and definitions}

\pnum
\indextext{declaration!definition~versus}%
\indextext{declaration}%
\indextext{declaration!name}%
A declaration (Clause~\ref{dcl.dcl}) may introduce
one or more names into a translation
unit or redeclare names introduced by previous declarations.
If so, the
declaration specifies the interpretation and attributes of these names.
A declaration may also have effects including:
\begin{itemize}
\item a static assertion (Clause~\ref{dcl.dcl}),
\item controlling template instantiation~(\ref{temp.explicit}),
\item guiding template argument deduction for constructors~(\ref{temp.deduct.guide}),
\item use of attributes (Clause~\ref{dcl.dcl}), and
\item nothing (in the case of an \grammarterm{empty-declaration}).
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\indextext{declaration!function}%
\indextext{definition}%
A declaration is a \defn{definition} unless
\begin{itemize}
\item
it declares a function
without specifying the function's body~(\ref{dcl.fct.def}),
\item
it contains
the
\indextext{declaration!\idxcode{extern}}%
\tcode{extern} specifier~(\ref{dcl.stc}) or a
\grammarterm{linkage-specification}\footnote{Appearing inside the braced-enclosed
\grammarterm{declaration-seq} in a \grammarterm{linkage-specification} does
not affect whether a declaration is a definition.}
(\ref{dcl.link}) and neither an \grammarterm{initializer} nor a
\grammarterm{function-body},
\item
\indextext{declaration!\idxcode{static member}}%
it declares a non-inline static data member in a class
definition (\ref{class.mem},~\ref{class.static}),
\item
it declares a static data member outside a class definition
and the variable was defined within the class with the \tcode{constexpr}
specifier (this usage is deprecated; see \ref{depr.static_constexpr}),
\item
\indextext{declaration!class~name}%
it is a class name declaration~(\ref{class.name}),
\item
it is an
\indextext{declaration!opaque~enum}%
\grammarterm{opaque-enum-declaration}~(\ref{dcl.enum}),
\item
it is a
\indextext{parameter!template}\indextext{template parameter}%
\grammarterm{template-parameter}~(\ref{temp.param}),
\item
it is a
\indextext{declaration!parameter}\indextext{parameter declaration}%
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration}~(\ref{dcl.fct}) in a function
\indextext{declarator}%
declarator that is not the \grammarterm{declarator} of a
\grammarterm{function-definition},
\item
it is a
\indextext{declaration!\idxcode{typedef}}%
\tcode{typedef} declaration~(\ref{dcl.typedef}),
\item it is
an \grammarterm{alias-declaration}~(\ref{dcl.typedef}),
\item it is
a
\grammarterm{using-declaration}~(\ref{namespace.udecl}),
\item it is
a \grammarterm{deduction-guide}~(\ref{temp.deduct.guide}),
\item it is
a \grammarterm{static_assert-declaration} (Clause~\ref{dcl.dcl}),
\item
it is an
\grammarterm{attribute-declaration} (Clause~\ref{dcl.dcl}),
\item
it is an
\grammarterm{empty-declaration} (Clause~\ref{dcl.dcl}),
\item it is
a \grammarterm{using-directive}~(\ref{namespace.udir}),
\item it is
an explicit instantiation declaration~(\ref{temp.explicit}), or
\item it is
an explicit specialization~(\ref{temp.expl.spec}) whose
\grammarterm{declaration} is not a definition.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example} all but one of the following are definitions:
\indextext{example!definition}%
\begin{codeblock}
int a;                          // defines \tcode{a}
extern const int c = 1;         // defines \tcode{c}

No translation unit shall contain more than one definition of any

\pnum
An expression is \defn{potentially evaluated} unless it is an
unevaluated operand (Clause~\ref{expr}) or a subexpression thereof.
The set of \defn{potential results} of an expression \tcode{e} is
defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{e} is an
\grammarterm{id-expression}~(\ref{expr.prim.id}), the set
contains only \tcode{e}.
\item If \tcode{e} is a subscripting operation~(\ref{expr.sub}) with
an array operand, the set contains the potential results of that operand.
\item If \tcode{e} is a class member access
expression~(\ref{expr.ref}), the set contains the potential results of
the object expression.
\item If \tcode{e} is a pointer-to-member
expression~(\ref{expr.mptr.oper}) whose second operand is a constant
expression, the set contains the potential results of the object
expression.
\item If \tcode{e} has the form \tcode{(e1)}, the set contains the
potential results of \tcode{e1}.
\item If \tcode{e} is a glvalue conditional
expression~(\ref{expr.cond}), the set is the union of the sets of
potential results of the second and third operands.
\item If \tcode{e} is a comma expression~(\ref{expr.comma}), the set
contains the potential results of the right operand.
\item Otherwise, the set is empty.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
This set is a (possibly-empty) set of \grammarterm{id-expression}{s},
each of which is either \tcode{e} or a subexpression of \tcode{e}.
\begin{example}
In the following example, the set of potential results of the initializer
of \tcode{n} contains the first \tcode{S::x} subexpression, but not the second
\tcode{S::x} subexpression.
\begin{codeblock}
struct S { static const int x = 0; };
const int &f(const int &r);
int n = b ? (1, S::x)  // \tcode{S::x} is not odr-used here
          : f(S::x);   // \tcode{S::x} is odr-used here, so
                       // a definition is required
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{note}

\pnum
A variable \tcode{x} whose name appears as a
potentially-evaluated expression \tcode{ex} is \defn{odr-used} by \tcode{ex} unless
applying the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (\ref{conv.lval}) to \tcode{x} yields
a constant expression~(\ref{expr.const}) that does not invoke any non-trivial
functions
and, if \tcode{x} is an object, \tcode{ex} is an element of
the set of potential results of an expression \tcode{e}, where either the lvalue-to-rvalue
conversion~(\ref{conv.lval}) is applied to \tcode{e}, or \tcode{e} is
a discarded-value expression~(Clause \ref{expr}).
\tcode{this} is odr-used if it appears as a potentially-evaluated expression
(including as the result of the implicit transformation in the body of a non-static
member function~(\ref{class.mfct.non-static})).
A virtual member
function is odr-used if it is not pure.
A function whose name appears as a potentially-evaluated
expression is odr-used if it is the unique lookup result or the selected
member of a set of overloaded functions~(\ref{basic.lookup}, \ref{over.match}, \ref{over.over}),
unless it is a pure virtual function and either
its name is not explicitly qualified or
the expression forms a pointer to member~(\ref{expr.unary.op}).
\begin{note} This covers calls to named
functions~(\ref{expr.call}), operator overloading (Clause~\ref{over}),
user-defined conversions~(\ref{class.conv.fct}), allocation functions for
placement \grammarterm{new-expression}{s}~(\ref{expr.new}), as well as non-default
initialization~(\ref{dcl.init}). A constructor selected to copy or move an
object of class type is odr-used even if the
call is actually elided by the implementation~(\ref{class.copy}). \end{note} An allocation
or deallocation function for a class is odr-used by a \grammarterm{new-expression}
appearing in a potentially-evaluated expression as specified
in~\ref{expr.new} and~\ref{class.free}. A deallocation function for a
class is odr-used by a delete expression appearing in a
potentially-evaluated expression as specified in~\ref{expr.delete}
and~\ref{class.free}. A non-placement allocation or deallocation
function for a class is odr-used by the definition of a constructor of that
class. A non-placement deallocation function for a class is odr-used by the
definition of the destructor of that class, or by being selected by the
lookup at the point of definition of a virtual
destructor~(\ref{class.dtor}).\footnote{An implementation is not required
to call allocation and
deallocation functions from constructors or destructors; however, this
is a permissible implementation technique.}
An assignment operator function in a class is odr-used by an
implicitly-defined
copy-assignment or move-assignment function for another class as specified
in~\ref{class.copy}.
A constructor for a class is odr-used as specified
in~\ref{dcl.init}. A destructor for a class is odr-used if it is potentially
invoked~(\ref{class.dtor}).

\pnum
Every program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline
function or variable that is odr-used in that program
outside of a discarded statement~(\ref{stmt.if}); no diagnostic required.
The definition can appear explicitly in the program, it can be found in
the standard or a user-defined library, or (when appropriate) it is
implicitly defined (see~\ref{class.ctor}, \ref{class.dtor} and
\ref{class.copy}). An inline function or variable shall be defined in every
translation unit in which it is odr-used outside of a discarded statement.

\pnum
\indextext{type!incomplete}%
Exactly one definition of a class is required in a translation unit if
the class is used in a way that requires the class type to be complete.
\begin{example} the following complete translation unit is well-formed,
even though it never defines \tcode{X}:

\begin{codeblock}
struct X;                       // declare \tcode{X} as a struct type
struct X* x1;                   // use \tcode{X} in pointer formation
X* x2;                          // use \tcode{X} in pointer formation
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note} The rules for declarations and expressions
describe in which contexts complete class types are required. A class
type \tcode{T} must be complete if:
\begin{itemize}
\item an object of type \tcode{T} is defined~(\ref{basic.def}), or
\item a non-static class data member of type \tcode{T} is
declared~(\ref{class.mem}), or
\item \tcode{T} is used as the object type or array element type in a
\grammarterm{new-expression}~(\ref{expr.new}), or
\item an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to
a glvalue referring
to an object of type \tcode{T}~(\ref{conv.lval}), or
\item an expression is converted (either implicitly or explicitly) to
type \tcode{T} (Clause~\ref{conv}, \ref{expr.type.conv},
\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}, \ref{expr.static.cast}, \ref{expr.cast}), or
\item an expression that is not a null pointer constant, and has type
other than \cv{} \tcode{void*}, is converted to the type pointer to \tcode{T}
or reference to \tcode{T} using a standard conversion
(Clause~\ref{conv}), a \tcode{dynamic_cast}~(\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}) or
a \tcode{static_cast}~(\ref{expr.static.cast}), or
\item a class member access operator is applied to an expression of type
\tcode{T}~(\ref{expr.ref}), or
\item the \tcode{typeid} operator~(\ref{expr.typeid}) or the
\tcode{sizeof} operator~(\ref{expr.sizeof}) is applied to an operand of
type \tcode{T}, or
\item a function with a return type or argument type of type \tcode{T}
is defined~(\ref{basic.def}) or called~(\ref{expr.call}), or
\item a class with a base class of type \tcode{T} is
defined (Clause~\ref{class.derived}), or
\item an lvalue of type \tcode{T} is assigned to~(\ref{expr.ass}), or
\item the type \tcode{T} is the subject of an
\tcode{alignof} expression~(\ref{expr.alignof}), or
\item an \grammarterm{exception-declaration} has type \tcode{T}, reference to
\tcode{T}, or pointer to \tcode{T}~(\ref{except.handle}).
\end{itemize}
\end{note}

\pnum
There can be more than one definition of a class type
(Clause~\ref{class}), enumeration type~(\ref{dcl.enum}), inline function
with external linkage~(\ref{dcl.inline}), inline variable with external
linkage~(\ref{dcl.inline}), class template
(Clause~\ref{temp}), non-static function template~(\ref{temp.fct}),
static data member of a class template~(\ref{temp.static}), member
function of a class template~(\ref{temp.mem.func}), or template
specialization for which some template parameters are not
specified~(\ref{temp.spec}, \ref{temp.class.spec}) in a program provided
that each definition appears in a different translation unit, and
provided the definitions satisfy the following requirements. Given such
an entity named \tcode{D} defined in more than one translation unit,
then
\begin{itemize}
\item each definition of \tcode{D} shall consist of the same sequence of
tokens; and
\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, corresponding names, looked up
according to~\ref{basic.lookup}, shall refer to an entity defined within
the definition of \tcode{D}, or shall refer to the same entity, after
overload resolution~(\ref{over.match}) and after matching of partial
template specialization~(\ref{temp.over}), except that a name can refer to
\begin{itemize}
\item
a non-volatile \tcode{const} object with internal or no linkage if the object
\begin{itemize}
\item has the same literal type in all definitions of \tcode{D},
\item is initialized with a constant expression~(\ref{expr.const}),
\item is not odr-used, and
\item has the same value in all definitions of \tcode{D},
\end{itemize}
or
\item
a reference with internal or no linkage
initialized with a constant expression such that
the reference refers to the same entity in all definitions of \tcode{D};
\end{itemize}
and

\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, corresponding entities shall have the
same language linkage; and

\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, the overloaded operators referred
to, the implicit calls to conversion functions, constructors, operator
new functions and operator delete functions, shall refer to the same
function, or to a function defined within the definition of \tcode{D};
and

\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, a default argument used by an
(implicit or explicit) function call is treated as if its token sequence
were present in the definition of \tcode{D}; that is, the default
argument is subject to the requirements described in this paragraph (and, if
the default argument has subexpressions with default arguments, this
requirement applies recursively).\footnote{\ref{dcl.fct.default} 
describes how default argument names are looked up.}

\item if \tcode{D} is a class with an implicitly-declared
constructor~(\ref{class.ctor}), it is as if the constructor was
implicitly defined in every translation unit where it is odr-used, and the
implicit definition in every translation unit shall call the same
constructor for a subobject of \tcode{D}.
\begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
// translation unit 1:
struct X {
  X(int, int);
  X(int, int, int);
};
X::X(int, int = 0) { }
class D {
  X x = 0;
};
D d1;                           // \tcode{X(int, int)} called by \tcode{D()}

// translation unit 2:
struct X {
  X(int, int);
  X(int, int, int);
};
X::X(int, int = 0, int = 0) { }
class D {
  X x = 0;
};
D d2;                           // \tcode{X(int, int, int)} called by \tcode{D()};
                                // \tcode{D()}'s implicit definition violates the ODR
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{itemize}
If \tcode{D} is a template and is defined in more than one
translation unit, then the preceding requirements
shall apply both to names from the template's enclosing scope used in the
template definition~(\ref{temp.nondep}), and also to dependent names at
the point of instantiation~(\ref{temp.dep}). If the definitions of
\tcode{D} satisfy all these requirements, then the behavior is
as if there were a single definition of \tcode{D}. If the definitions of
\tcode{D} do not satisfy these requirements, then the behavior is
undefined.%

each particular name is valid only within some possibly discontiguous
portion of program text called its \defn{scope}. To determine the
scope of a declaration, it is sometimes convenient to refer to the
\defn{potential scope} of a declaration. The scope of a declaration
is the same as its potential scope unless the potential scope contains
another declaration of the same name. In that case, the potential scope
of the declaration in the inner (contained) declarative region is
excluded from the scope of the declaration in the outer (containing)
declarative region.

the identifier \tcode{j} is declared twice as a name (and used twice).
The declarative region of the first \tcode{j} includes the entire
example. The potential scope of the first \tcode{j} begins immediately
after that \tcode{j} and extends to the end of the program, but its
(actual) scope excludes the text between the \tcode{,} and the
\tcode{\}}. The declarative region of the second declaration of
\tcode{j} (the \tcode{j} immediately before the semicolon) includes all
the text between \tcode{\{} and \tcode{\}}, but its potential scope
excludes the declaration of \tcode{i}. The scope of the second
declaration of \tcode{j} is the same as its potential scope.
\end{example}

\pnum
The names declared by a declaration are introduced into the scope in
which the declaration occurs, except that the presence of a

\grammarterm{using-directive}{s}~(\ref{namespace.udir}) alter this general
behavior.

Given a set of declarations in a single declarative region, each of
which specifies the same unqualified name,
\begin{itemize}
\item they shall all refer to the same entity, or all refer to functions

\item exactly one declaration shall declare a class name or enumeration
name that is not a typedef name and the other declarations shall
all refer to the same variable, non-static data member, or enumerator,
or all refer to functions and function templates;
in this case the class name or enumeration name is
hidden~(\ref{basic.scope.hiding}). \begin{note} A namespace name or a
class template name must be unique in its declarative
region~(\ref{namespace.alias}, Clause~\ref{temp}). \end{note}
\end{itemize}
\begin{note} These restrictions apply to the declarative region into which
a name is introduced, which is not necessarily the same as the region in
which the declaration occurs. In particular,
\grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier}{s}~(\ref{dcl.type.elab}) and
friend declarations~(\ref{class.friend}) may introduce a (possibly not
visible) name into an enclosing namespace; these restrictions apply to
that region. Local extern declarations~(\ref{basic.link}) may introduce
a name into the declarative region where the declaration appears and
also introduce a (possibly not visible) name into an enclosing
namespace; these restrictions apply to both regions. \end{note}

\grammarterm{opaque-enum-declaration}~(\ref{dcl.enum}), whichever comes first.
The point of declaration of an alias or alias template immediately
follows the \grammarterm{type-id} to which the
alias refers.

otherwise
\item for an \grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier} of the form

\begin{ncbnf}
class-key identifier

if the
\grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier} is used in the
\grammarterm{decl-specifier-seq} or \grammarterm{parameter-declaration-clause}

declared as a \grammarterm{class-name} in the namespace that contains the
declaration; otherwise, except as a friend declaration, the
\grammarterm{identifier} is declared in the smallest namespace or block
scope that contains the declaration. \begin{note}
These rules also apply within templates. \end{note} \begin{note} Other
forms of \grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier} do not declare a new name,

The declarative region of the name of a template parameter of a template

in which the name was introduced.

\pnum
The declarative region of the name of a template parameter of a template is the smallest
\grammarterm{template-declaration} in which the name was introduced. Only template
parameter names belong to this declarative region; any other kind of name introduced by
the \grammarterm{declaration} of a \grammarterm{template-declaration} is instead
introduced into the same declarative region where it would be introduced as a result of
a non-template declaration of the same name. \begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
namespace N {
  template<class T> struct A { };               // \#1
  template<class U> void f(U) { }               // \#2
  struct B {
    template<class V> friend int g(struct C*);  // \#3
  };
}
\end{codeblock}

The declarative regions of \tcode{T}, \tcode{U} and \tcode{V} are the
\grammarterm{template-declaration}{s} on lines \tcode{\#1}, \tcode{\#2} and \tcode{\#3},
respectively. But the names \tcode{A}, \tcode{f}, \tcode{g} and \tcode{C} all belong to
the same declarative region --- namely, the \grammarterm{namespace-body} of \tcode{N}.
(\tcode{g} is still considered to belong to this declarative region in spite of its
being hidden during qualified and unqualified name lookup.)
\end{example}

\pnum
The potential scope of a template parameter name begins at its point of
declaration~(\ref{basic.scope.pdecl}) and ends at the end of its declarative region.
\begin{note} This implies that a \grammarterm{template-parameter} can be used in the
declaration of subsequent \grammarterm{template-parameter}{s} and their default
arguments but cannot be used in preceding \grammarterm{template-parameter}{s} or their
default arguments. For example,

\begin{codeblock}
template<class T, T* p, class U = T> class X { /* ... */ };
template<class T> void f(T* p = new T);
\end{codeblock}

This also implies that a \grammarterm{template-parameter} can be used in the
specification of base classes. For example,

\begin{codeblock}
template<class T> class X : public Array<T> { /* ... */ };
template<class T> class Y : public T { /* ... */ };
\end{codeblock}

The use of a template parameter as a base class implies that a class used as a template
argument must be defined and not just declared when the class template is instantiated.
\end{note}

\pnum
The declarative region of the name of a template parameter is nested within the
immediately-enclosing declarative region. \begin{note} As a result, a
\grammarterm{template-parameter} hides any entity with the same name in an enclosing
scope~(\ref{basic.scope.hiding}). \begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
typedef int N;
template<N X, typename N, template<N Y> class T> struct A;
\end{codeblock}

Here, \tcode{X} is a non-type template parameter of type \tcode{int} and \tcode{Y} is a
non-type template parameter of the same type as the second template parameter of
\tcode{A}. \end{example}\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note} Because the name of a template parameter cannot be redeclared within its
potential scope~(\ref{temp.local}), a template parameter's scope is often its potential
scope. However, it is still possible for a template parameter name to be hidden;
see~\ref{temp.local}. \end{note}

A class name~(\ref{class.name}) or enumeration name~(\ref{dcl.enum}) can

or enumerator are declared in the same scope (in any order) with the
same name, the class or enumeration name is hidden wherever the variable, data member,
function, or enumerator name is visible.

\pnum
In a member function definition, the declaration of a name

hides
the declaration of a member of the class with the same name;

The name lookup rules apply uniformly to all names (including

\grammarterm{namespace-name}{s}~(\ref{basic.namespace}), and
\grammarterm{class-name}{s}~(\ref{class.name})) wherever the grammar allows
such names in the context discussed by a particular rule. Name lookup
associates the use of a name with a declaration~(\ref{basic.def}) of
that name. Name lookup shall find an unambiguous declaration for the
name (see~\ref{class.member.lookup}). Name lookup may associate more
than one declaration with a name if it finds the name to be a function
name; the declarations are said to form a set of overloaded
functions~(\ref{over.load}). Overload resolution~(\ref{over.match})
takes place after name lookup has succeeded. The access rules
(Clause~\ref{class.access}) are considered only once name lookup and
function overload resolution (if applicable) have succeeded. Only after
name lookup, function overload resolution (if applicable) and access
checking have succeeded are the attributes introduced by the name's
declaration used further in expression processing (Clause~\ref{expr}).

\pnum
A name ``looked up in the context of an expression'' is looked up as an
unqualified name in the scope where the expression is found.

\pnum
\indextext{lookup!unqualified~name}%
\indextext{name!unqualified}%
In all the cases listed in~\ref{basic.lookup.unqual}, the scopes are
searched for a declaration in the order listed in each of the respective
categories; name lookup ends as soon as a declaration is found for the
name. If no declaration is found, the program is ill-formed.

\pnum
The declarations from the namespace nominated by a
\grammarterm{using-directive} become visible in a namespace enclosing the
\grammarterm{using-directive}; see~\ref{namespace.udir}. For the purpose of
the unqualified name lookup rules described
in~\ref{basic.lookup.unqual}, the declarations from the namespace
nominated by the \grammarterm{using-directive} are considered members of
that enclosing namespace.

\pnum
The lookup for an unqualified name used as the
\grammarterm{postfix-expression} of a function call is described
in~\ref{basic.lookup.argdep}. \begin{note} For purposes of determining
(during parsing) whether an expression is a
\grammarterm{postfix-expression} for a function call, the usual name lookup
rules apply. The rules in~\ref{basic.lookup.argdep} have no effect on
the syntactic interpretation of an expression. For example,

\begin{codeblock}
typedef int f;
namespace N {
  struct A {
    friend void f(A &);
    operator int();
    void g(A a) {
      int i = f(a);         // \tcode{f} is the typedef, not the friend
                            // function: equivalent to \tcode{int(a)}
    }
  };
}
\end{codeblock}

Because the expression is not a function call, the argument-dependent
name lookup~(\ref{basic.lookup.argdep}) does not apply and the friend
function \tcode{f} is not found. \end{note}

its enclosing blocks~(\ref{stmt.block}) or shall be declared before its

When the \grammarterm{postfix-expression} in
a function call~(\ref{expr.call}) is an \grammarterm{unqualified-id}, other namespaces not considered
during the usual unqualified lookup~(\ref{basic.lookup.unqual}) may be
searched, and in those namespaces, namespace-scope friend function or
function template declarations~(\ref{class.friend}) not otherwise
visible may be found.
These modifications to the search depend on the types of the arguments
(and for template template arguments, the namespace of the template
argument).
\begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
namespace N {
  struct S { };
  void f(S);
}

void g() {
  N::S s;
  f(s);                         // OK: calls \tcode{N::f}

}
\end{codeblock}

\end{example}

\pnum
For each argument type \tcode{T} in the function call, there is a set of
zero or more \defnx{associated namespaces}{namespace!associated}
and a set of zero or more \defnx{associated classes}{class!associated}
to be considered. The sets of namespaces and classes are
determined entirely by the types of the function arguments (and the
namespace of any template template argument). Typedef names and
\grammarterm{using-declaration}{s} used to specify the types do not
contribute to this set. The sets of namespaces and classes are
determined in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{T} is a fundamental type, its associated sets of
namespaces and classes are both empty.

\item If \tcode{T} is a class type (including unions), its associated
classes are: the class itself; the class of which it is a member, if
any; and its direct and indirect base classes. Its associated namespaces
are the innermost enclosing namespaces of its associated classes.
Furthermore, if \tcode{T} is a class template specialization, its
associated namespaces and classes also include: the namespaces and
classes associated with the types of the template arguments provided for
template type parameters (excluding template template parameters); the
namespaces of which any template template arguments are members; and the
classes of which any member templates used as template template
arguments are members. \begin{note} Non-type template arguments do not
contribute to the set of associated namespaces.\end{note}

\item If \tcode{T} is an enumeration type, its associated namespace is
the innermost enclosing namespace of its declaration. If it is a class member, its
associated class is the member's class; else it has no associated class.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to \tcode{U} or an array of \tcode{U},
its associated namespaces and classes are those associated with
\tcode{U}.

\item If \tcode{T} is a function type, its associated namespaces and
classes are those associated with the function parameter types and those
associated with the return type.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a member function of a class
\tcode{X}, its associated namespaces and classes are those associated
with the function parameter types and return type, together with those
associated with \tcode{X}.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a data member of class \tcode{X}, its
associated namespaces and classes are those associated with the member
type together with those associated with \tcode{X}.
\end{itemize}
If an associated namespace is an inline namespace~(\ref{namespace.def}), its
enclosing namespace is also included in the set. If an associated namespace
directly contains inline namespaces, those inline namespaces are also included
in the set.
In addition, if the argument is the name or address of a set of
overloaded functions and/or function templates, its associated classes
and namespaces are the union of those associated with each of the
members of the set, i.e., the classes and namespaces associated with its
parameter types and return type.
Additionally, if the aforementioned set of overloaded functions is named with
a \grammarterm{template-id}, its associated classes and namespaces also include
those of its type \grammarterm{template-argument}{s} and its template
\grammarterm{template-argument}{s}.

\pnum
Let \placeholder{X} be the lookup set produced by unqualified
lookup~(\ref{basic.lookup.unqual}) and let \placeholder{Y} be the lookup set produced

\begin{itemize}
\item a declaration of a class member, or
\item a block-scope function declaration that is not a \grammarterm{using-declaration}, or
\item a declaration that is neither a function nor a function template
\end{itemize}
then \placeholder{Y} is empty. Otherwise \placeholder{Y} is the set of declarations
found in the namespaces associated with the argument types as described
below. The set of declarations found by the lookup of the name is the
union of \placeholder{X} and \placeholder{Y}. \begin{note} The namespaces and classes
associated with the argument types can include namespaces and classes
already considered by the ordinary unqualified lookup. \end{note}
\begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
namespace NS {
  class T { };
  void f(T);
  void g(T, int);
}
NS::T parm;

ignored.

\item Any namespace-scope friend functions or friend function templates
declared in associated classes are visible within their respective
namespaces even if they are not visible during an ordinary

function templates are ignored.

finds more than one declaration of the member, and if one declaration
introduces a class name or enumeration name and the other declarations
either introduce the same variable, the same enumerator or a set of

only if the declarations are from the same namespace; otherwise (the
declarations are from different namespaces), the program is ill-formed.

\pnum
The name of a function declared in block scope and the name of a variable declared by a
block scope \tcode{extern} declaration have linkage. If there is a visible declaration
of an entity with linkage having the same name and type, ignoring entities declared
outside the innermost enclosing namespace scope, the block scope declaration declares
that same entity and receives the linkage of the previous declaration. If there is more
than one such matching entity, the program is ill-formed. Otherwise, if no matching
entity is found, the block scope entity receives external linkage. \begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
static void f();
static int i = 0;               // \#1
void g() {
  extern void f();              // internal linkage

    extern int i;               // \#3 external linkage

There are three objects named \tcode{i} in this program. The object with
internal linkage introduced by the declaration in global scope (line
\tcode{\#1} ), the object with automatic storage duration and no linkage
introduced by the declaration on line \tcode{\#2}, and the object with
static storage duration and external linkage introduced by the
declaration on line \tcode{\#3}. \end{example}

\pnum
When a block scope declaration of an entity with linkage is not found to
refer to some other declaration, then that entity is a member of the
innermost enclosing namespace. However such a declaration does not

\pnum
\indextext{linkage!no}%
Names not covered by these rules have no linkage. Moreover, except as
noted, a name declared at block scope~(\ref{basic.scope.block}) has no
linkage. A type is said to have linkage if and only if:
\begin{itemize}
\item it is a class or enumeration type that is named (or has a name for
linkage purposes~(\ref{dcl.typedef})) and the name has linkage; or

\item it is an unnamed class or unnamed enumeration that is a member of a class
with linkage; or

\item it is a specialization of a class template (Clause~\ref{temp})\footnote{A class
template has the linkage of the innermost enclosing class or namespace in which
it is declared.};
or

\item it is a fundamental type~(\ref{basic.fundamental}); or

\item it is a compound type~(\ref{basic.compound}) other than a class or
enumeration, compounded exclusively from types that have linkage; or

\item it is a cv-qualified~(\ref{basic.type.qualifier}) version of a
type that has linkage.
\end{itemize}
A type without linkage shall not be used as the type of a variable or
function with external linkage unless
\begin{itemize}
\item the entity has C language linkage~(\ref{dcl.link}), or

\item the entity is declared within an unnamed
namespace~(\ref{namespace.def}), or

\item the entity is not odr-used~(\ref{basic.def.odr}) or is defined in
the same translation unit.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
In other words, a type without linkage contains a class or enumeration that
cannot be named outside its translation unit. An entity with external linkage declared
using such a type could not correspond to any other entity in another translation unit
of the program and thus must be defined in the
translation unit if it is odr-used. Also note that classes with linkage may contain members
whose types do not have linkage, and that typedef names are ignored in the determination
of whether a type has linkage.

\begin{codeblock}
template <class T> struct B {
  void g(T) { }
  void h(T);
  friend void i(B, T) { }

first parameter shall not have an associated default
argument~(\ref{dcl.fct.default}). The value of the first parameter shall
be interpreted as the requested size of the allocation. An allocation
function can be a function template. Such a template shall declare its
return type and first parameter as specified above (that is, template
parameter types shall not be used in the return type and first parameter
type). Template allocation functions shall have two or more parameters.

\pnum
The allocation function attempts to allocate the requested amount of
storage. If it is successful, it shall return the address of the start
of a block of storage whose length in bytes shall be at least as large
as the requested size. There are no constraints on the contents of the
allocated storage on return from the allocation function. The order,
contiguity, and initial value of storage allocated by successive calls
to an allocation function are unspecified. The pointer returned shall be
suitably aligned so that it can be converted to a pointer to any
suitable complete object type~(\ref{new.delete.single})
and then used to access the object or array in the
storage allocated (until the storage is explicitly deallocated by a call
to a corresponding deallocation function). Even if the size of the space
requested is zero, the request can fail. If the request succeeds, the
value returned shall be a non-null pointer value~(\ref{conv.ptr})
\tcode{p0} different from any previously returned value \tcode{p1},
unless that value \tcode{p1} was subsequently passed to an
\tcode{operator} \tcode{delete}.
Furthermore, for the library allocation functions
in~\ref{new.delete.single} and~\ref{new.delete.array},
\tcode{p0} shall represent the address of a block of storage disjoint from the storage
for any other object accessible to the caller.
The effect of indirecting through a pointer
returned as a request for zero size is undefined.\footnote{The intent is
to have \tcode{operator new()} implementable by
calling \tcode{std::malloc()} or \tcode{std::calloc()}, so the rules are
substantially the same. \Cpp differs from C in requiring a zero request
to return a non-null pointer.}

currently installed \tcode{new_handler} using the

If an allocation function that has a non-throwing
exception specification~(\ref{except.spec})
fails to allocate storage, it shall return a null pointer. Any other
allocation function that fails to allocate storage shall indicate
failure only by throwing an exception~(\ref{except.throw}) of a type
that would match a handler~(\ref{except.handle}) of type
\tcode{std::bad_alloc}~(\ref{bad.alloc}).

\pnum
The properties ascribed to objects and references throughout this International
Standard apply for a given object or reference only during its lifetime. \begin{note}
In particular, before the lifetime of an object starts and after its
lifetime ends there are significant restrictions on the use of the
object, as described below, in~\ref{class.base.init} and
in~\ref{class.cdtor}. Also, the behavior of an object under construction
and destruction might not be the same as the behavior of an object whose
lifetime has started and not ended. \ref{class.base.init}
and~\ref{class.cdtor} describe the behavior of objects during the
construction and destruction phases. \end{note}

\pnum
A program may end the lifetime of any object by reusing the storage
which the object occupies or by explicitly calling the destructor for an
object of a class type with a non-trivial destructor. For an object of a
class type with a non-trivial destructor, the program is not required to
call the destructor explicitly before the storage which the object
occupies is reused or released; however, if there is no explicit call to
the destructor or if a \grammarterm{delete-expression}~(\ref{expr.delete})
is not used to release the storage, the destructor shall not be
implicitly called and any program that depends on the side effects
produced by the destructor has undefined behavior.

\pnum
Before the lifetime of an object has started but after the storage which
the object will occupy has been allocated\footnote{For example, before the
construction of a global object of
non-POD class type~(\ref{class.cdtor}).}
or, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage
which the object occupied is reused or released, any pointer that represents the address of
the storage location where the object will be or was located may be
used but only in limited ways.
For an object under construction or destruction, see~\ref{class.cdtor}.
Otherwise, such
a pointer refers to allocated
storage~(\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation}), and using the pointer as
if the pointer were of type \tcode{void*}, is
well-defined. Indirection through such a pointer is permitted but the resulting lvalue may only be used in
limited ways, as described below. The
program has undefined behavior if:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  the object will be or was of a class type with a non-trivial destructor
  and the pointer is used as the operand of a \grammarterm{delete-expression},
\item
  the pointer is used to access a non-static data member or call a
  non-static member function of the object, or
\item
  the pointer is implicitly converted~(\ref{conv.ptr}) to a pointer
  to a virtual base class, or
\item
  the pointer is used as the operand of a
  \tcode{static_cast}~(\ref{expr.static.cast}), except when the conversion
  is to pointer to \cv{} \tcode{void}, or to pointer to \cv{}
  \tcode{void} and subsequently to pointer to either \cv{}
  \tcode{char} or \cv{} \tcode{unsigned char}, or
\item
  the pointer is used as the operand of a
  \tcode{dynamic_cast}~(\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}).
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
#include <cstdlib>

struct B {
  virtual void f();
  void mutate();
  virtual ~B();
};

struct D1 : B { void f(); };
struct D2 : B { void f(); };

void B::mutate() {
  new (this) D2;    // reuses storage --- ends the lifetime of \tcode{*this}
  f();              // undefined behavior
  ... = this;       // OK, \tcode{this} points to valid memory
}

void g() {
  void* p = std::malloc(sizeof(D1) + sizeof(D2));
  B* pb = new (p) D1;
  pb->mutate();
  *pb;              // OK: \tcode{pb} points to valid memory
  void* q = pb;     // OK: \tcode{pb} points to valid memory
  pb->f();          // undefined behavior, lifetime of \tcode{*pb} has ended
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
Similarly, before the lifetime of an object has started but after the
storage which the object will occupy has been allocated or, after the
lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which the object
occupied is reused or released, any glvalue that refers to the original
object may be used but only in limited ways.
For an object under construction or destruction, see~\ref{class.cdtor}.
Otherwise, such
a glvalue refers to
allocated storage~(\ref{basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation}), and using the
properties of the glvalue that do not depend on its value is
well-defined. The program has undefined behavior if:
\begin{itemize}
\item the glvalue is used to access the object, or
\item the glvalue is used to call a non-static member function of the object, or
\item the glvalue is bound to a reference to a virtual base class~(\ref{dcl.init.ref}), or
\item the glvalue is used as the operand of a
\tcode{dynamic_cast}~(\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}) or as the operand of
\tcode{typeid}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
If, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage
which the object occupied is reused or released, a new object is created
at the storage location which the original object occupied, a pointer
that pointed to the original object, a reference that referred to the
original object, or the name of the original object will automatically
refer to the new object and, once the lifetime of the new object has
started, can be used to manipulate the new object, if:
\begin{itemize}
\item the storage for the new object exactly overlays the storage
location which the original object occupied, and

\item the new object is of the same type as the original object
(ignoring the top-level cv-qualifiers), and

\item the type of the original object is not const-qualified, and, if a
class type, does not contain any non-static data member whose type is
const-qualified or a reference type, and

\item the original object was a most derived object~(\ref{intro.object})
of type \tcode{T} and the new object is a most derived object of type
\tcode{T} (that is, they are not base class subobjects).
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct C {
  int i;
  void f();
  const C& operator=( const C& );
};

const C& C::operator=( const C& other) {
  if ( this != &other ) {
    this->~C();                 // lifetime of \tcode{*this} ends
    new (this) C(other);        // new object of type \tcode{C} created
    f();                        // well-defined
  }
  return *this;
}

C c1;
C c2;
c1 = c2;                        // well-defined
c1.f();                         // well-defined; \tcode{c1} refers to a new object of type \tcode{C}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
If these conditions are not met,
a pointer to the new object can be obtained from
a pointer that represents the address of its storage
by calling \tcode{std::launder}~(\ref{support.dynamic}).
\end{note}

\pnum
If a program ends the lifetime of an object of type \tcode{T} with
static~(\ref{basic.stc.static}), thread~(\ref{basic.stc.thread}),
or automatic~(\ref{basic.stc.auto})
storage duration and if \tcode{T} has a non-trivial destructor,\footnote{That
is, an object for which a destructor will be called
implicitly---upon exit from the block for an object with
automatic storage duration, upon exit from the thread for an object with
thread storage duration, or upon exit from the program for an object
with static storage duration.}
the program must ensure that an object of the original type occupies
that same storage location when the implicit destructor call takes
place; otherwise the behavior of the program is undefined. This is true
even if the block is exited with an exception. \begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
class T { };
struct B {
   ~B();
};

void h() {
   B b;
   new (&b) T;
}                               // undefined behavior at block exit
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
Creating a new object within the storage that a \tcode{const} complete
object with static, thread, or automatic storage duration occupies,
or within the storage that such a \tcode{const} object used to occupy before
its lifetime ended, results in undefined behavior.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct B {
  B();
  ~B();
};

const B b;

void h() {
  b.~B();
  new (const_cast<B*>(&b)) const B;             // undefined behavior

\end{codeblock}

In this section, ``before'' and ``after'' refer to the ``happens before''

\defnx{integral}{integral~type} types.\footnote{Therefore, enumerations~(\ref{dcl.enum}) are not integral; however,
enumerations can be promoted to integral types as specified
in~\ref{conv.prom}.}
A synonym for integral type is
\indextext{signed integer representation!ones' complement}%
\indextext{signed integer representation!two's complement}%
\indextext{signed integer representation!signed magnitude}%
\defnx{integer type}{integer~type}. The representations of integral types shall
define values by use of a pure binary numeration system.\footnote{A positional
representation for integers that uses the binary digits 0
and 1, in which the values represented by successive bits are additive,
begin with 1, and are multiplied by successive integral power of 2,
except perhaps for the bit with the highest position. (Adapted from the
\doccite{American National Dictionary for Information Processing Systems}.)}
\begin{example} this International Standard permits two's complement,
ones' complement and signed magnitude representations for integral types.
\end{example}

\pnum
There are three \defnx{floating-point}{floating~point~type} types:
\indextext{type!\idxcode{float}}%
\tcode{float},
\indextext{type!\idxcode{double}}%
\tcode{double},
and
\indextext{type!\idxcode{long double}}%
\tcode{long double}. The type \tcode{double} provides at least as much
precision as \tcode{float}, and the type \tcode{long double} provides at
least as much precision as \tcode{double}. The set of values of the type
\tcode{float} is a subset of the set of values of the type
\tcode{double}; the set of values of the type \tcode{double} is a subset
of the set of values of the type \tcode{long} \tcode{double}. The value
representation of floating-point types is \impldef{value representation of
floating-point types}.
\indextext{floating~point~type!implementation-defined}%
\begin{note}
This International Standard imposes no requirements on the accuracy of
floating-point operations; see also~\ref{limits}. 
\end{note}
Integral and floating types are collectively
called \defnx{arithmetic}{type!arithmetic} types.
\indextext{\idxcode{numeric_limits}!specializations for arithmetic types}%
Specializations of the standard library template
\tcode{std::numeric_limits}~(\ref{support.limits}) shall specify the
maximum and minimum values of each arithmetic type for an
implementation.

\pnum
\indextext{type!\idxcode{void}}%
A type \cv{} \tcode{void}
is an incomplete type that cannot be completed; such a type has
an empty set of values. It is used as the return
type for functions that do not return a value. Any expression can be
explicitly converted to type \cv{} \tcode{void}~(\ref{expr.cast}).
An expression of type \cv{} \tcode{void} shall
be used only as an expression statement~(\ref{stmt.expr}), as an operand
of a comma expression~(\ref{expr.comma}), as a second or third operand
of \tcode{?:}~(\ref{expr.cond}), as the operand of
\tcode{typeid}, \tcode{noexcept}, or \tcode{decltype}, as
the expression in a return statement~(\ref{stmt.return}) for a function
with the return type \cv{} \tcode{void}, or as the operand of an explicit conversion
to type \cv{} \tcode{void}.

\pnum
A value of type \tcode{std::nullptr_t} is a null pointer
constant~(\ref{conv.ptr}). Such values participate in the pointer and the
pointer to member conversions~(\ref{conv.ptr}, \ref{conv.mem}).
\tcode{sizeof(std::nullptr_t)} shall be equal to \tcode{sizeof(void*)}.

\pnum
\begin{note}
Even if the implementation defines two or more basic types to have the
same value representation, they are nevertheless different types.
\end{note}

\rSec2[basic.compound]{Compound types}

\pnum
\indextext{type!compound}%
Compound types can be constructed in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item \defnx{arrays}{type!array} of objects of a given type,~\ref{dcl.array};

\item \defnx{functions}{type!function}, which have parameters of given types and return
\tcode{void} or references or objects of a given type,~\ref{dcl.fct};

\item \defnx{pointers}{type!pointer} to \cv{} \tcode{void} or objects or functions (including
static members of classes) of a given type,~\ref{dcl.ptr};

\item %
\indextext{reference!lvalue}%
\indextext{reference!rvalue}%
\defnx{references}{reference} to objects or functions of a given
type,~\ref{dcl.ref}. There are two types of references:
\begin{itemize}
\item \defnx{lvalue reference}{lvalue~reference}
\item \defnx{rvalue reference}{rvalue~reference}
\end{itemize}

\item
\defnx{classes}{class} containing a sequence of objects of various types
(Clause~\ref{class}), a set of types, enumerations and functions for
manipulating these objects~(\ref{class.mfct}), and a set of restrictions
on the access to these entities (Clause~\ref{class.access});

\item
\defnx{unions}{\idxcode{union}}, which are classes capable of containing objects of
different types at different times,~\ref{class.union};

\item
\defnx{enumerations}{\idxcode{enum}}, which comprise a set of named constant values.
Each distinct enumeration constitutes a different
\defnx{enumerated type}{type!enumerated},~\ref{dcl.enum};

\item \indextext{member~pointer~to|see{pointer to member}}%
\defnx{pointers to non-static class members}{pointer~to~member},%
\footnote{Static class members are objects or functions, and pointers to them are
ordinary pointers to objects or functions.}
which identify members of a given
type within objects of a given class,~\ref{dcl.mptr}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
These methods of constructing types can be applied recursively;
restrictions are mentioned in~\ref{dcl.ptr}, \ref{dcl.array},
\ref{dcl.fct}, and~\ref{dcl.ref}. Constructing a type such that the number of
bytes in its object representation exceeds the maximum value representable in
the type \tcode{std::size_t}~(\ref{support.types}) is ill-formed.

\pnum
\indextext{terminology!pointer}%
The type of a pointer to \cv{} \tcode{void} or a pointer to an object type is
called an \defn{object pointer type}. \begin{note} A pointer to \tcode{void}
does not have a pointer-to-object type, however, because \tcode{void} is not
an object type. \end{note} The type of a pointer that can designate a function
is called a \defn{function pointer type}.
A pointer to objects of type \tcode{T} is referred to as a ``pointer to
\tcode{T}''. \begin{example} a pointer to an object of type \tcode{int} is
referred to as ``pointer to \tcode{int} '' and a pointer to an object of
class \tcode{X} is called a ``pointer to \tcode{X}''. \end{example}
Except for pointers to static members, text referring to ``pointers''
does not apply to pointers to members. Pointers to incomplete types are
allowed although there are restrictions on what can be done with
them~(\ref{basic.align}).
\indextext{address}%
Every value of pointer type is one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
a \defn{pointer to} an object or function (the pointer is said to \defn{point} to the object or function), or
\item
a \defn{pointer past the end of} an object (\ref{expr.add}), or
\item
the \defn{null pointer value} (\ref{conv.ptr}) for that type, or
\item
an \defn{invalid pointer value}.
\end{itemize}
A value of a
pointer type
that is a pointer to or past the end of an object
\defn{represents the address} of
the first byte in memory~(\ref{intro.memory}) occupied by the object%
\footnote{For an object that is not within its lifetime,
this is the first byte in memory that it will occupy or used to occupy.}
or the first byte in memory
after the end of the storage occupied by the object,
respectively.
\begin{note}
A pointer past the end of an object~(\ref{expr.add})
is not considered to point to an unrelated object
of the object's type
that might be located at that address.
A pointer value becomes invalid
when the storage it denotes
reaches the end of its storage duration;
see \ref{basic.stc}.
\end{note}
For purposes of pointer arithmetic~(\ref{expr.add})
and comparison~(\ref{expr.rel}, \ref{expr.eq}),
a pointer past the end of the last element of
an array \tcode{x} of $n$ elements
is considered to be equivalent to
a pointer to a hypothetical element $\mathtt{x[}n\mathtt{]}$.
The value representation of
pointer types is \impldef{value representation of pointer types}. Pointers to
layout-compatible types shall
have the same value representation and alignment
requirements~(\ref{basic.align}).
\begin{note} Pointers to over-aligned types~(\ref{basic.align}) have no special
representation, but their range of valid values is restricted by the extended
alignment requirement.\end{note}

\pnum
Two objects \placeholder{a} and \placeholder{b} are \defn{pointer-interconvertible} if:
\begin{itemize}
\item
they are the same object, or
\item
one is a standard-layout union object and
the other is a non-static data member of that object~(\ref{class.union}), or
\item
one is a standard-layout class object and
the other is the first non-static data member of that object, or,
if the object has no non-static data members,
the first base class subobject of that object~(\ref{class.mem}), or
\item
there exists an object \placeholder{c} such that
\placeholder{a} and \placeholder{c} are pointer-interconvertible, and
\placeholder{c} and \placeholder{b} are pointer-interconvertible.
\end{itemize}
If two objects are pointer-interconvertible,
then they have the same address,
and it is possible to obtain a pointer to one
from a pointer to the other
via a \tcode{reinterpret_cast}~(\ref{expr.reinterpret.cast}).
\begin{note}
An array object and its first element are not pointer-interconvertible,
even though they have the same address.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{pointer|seealso{\tcode{void*}}}%
\indextext{\idxcode{void*}!type}%
A pointer to \cv-qualified~(\ref{basic.type.qualifier}) or \cv-unqualified
\tcode{void}
can be used to point to objects of
unknown type. Such a pointer shall be able to hold any object pointer.
An object of type \cv{}
\tcode{void*} shall have the same representation and alignment
requirements as \cv{} \tcode{char*}.

\rSec2[basic.type.qualifier]{CV-qualifiers}

\pnum
\indextext{cv-qualifier}%
\indextext{\idxcode{const}}%
\indextext{\idxcode{volatile}}%
A type mentioned in~\ref{basic.fundamental} and~\ref{basic.compound} is
a \defnx{cv-unqualified type}{type!cv-unqualified}. Each type which is a
cv-unqualified complete or incomplete object type or is
\tcode{void}~(\ref{basic.types}) has three corresponding cv-qualified
versions of its type: a \defn{const-qualified} version, a
\defn{volatile-qualified} version, and a
\defn{const-volatile-qualified} version. The term
\term{object type}~(\ref{intro.object}) includes the cv-qualifiers
specified in the \grammarterm{decl-specifier-seq}~(\ref{dcl.spec}), 
\grammarterm{declarator} (Clause~\ref{dcl.decl}),
\grammarterm{type-id}~(\ref{dcl.name}), or 
\grammarterm{new-type-id}~(\ref{expr.new}) when the object is created.
\begin{itemize}
\item A \defnx{const object}{object!const} is an object of type \tcode{const T} or a
  non-mutable subobject of such an object.

\item A \defnx{volatile object}{object!volatile} is an object of type
  \tcode{volatile T}, a subobject of such an object, or a mutable
  subobject of a const volatile object.

\item A \defnx{const volatile object}{object!const volatile} is an object of type
  \tcode{const volatile T}, a non-mutable subobject of such an object,
  a const subobject of a volatile object, or a non-mutable volatile
  subobject of a const object.
\end{itemize}
The cv-qualified or
cv-unqualified versions of a type
are distinct types; however, they shall have the same representation and
alignment requirements~(\ref{basic.align}).\footnote{The same representation
and alignment requirements are meant to imply
interchangeability as arguments to functions, return values from
functions, and non-static data members of unions.}

\pnum
\indextext{array!\idxcode{const}}%
A compound type~(\ref{basic.compound}) is not cv-qualified by the
cv-qualifiers (if any) of the types from which it is compounded. Any
cv-qualifiers applied to an array type affect the array element type,
not the array type~(\ref{dcl.array}).

\pnum
See~\ref{dcl.fct} and~\ref{class.this} regarding function
types that have \grammarterm{cv-qualifier}{s}.

\pnum
There is a partial ordering on cv-qualifiers, so that a type can be
said to be \grammarterm{more cv-qualified} than another.
Table~\ref{tab:relations.on.const.and.volatile} shows the relations that
constitute this ordering.

\begin{floattable}{Relations on \tcode{const} and \tcode{volatile}}{tab:relations.on.const.and.volatile}
{ccc}
\topline
\cvqual{no cv-qualifier}    &<& \tcode{const}           \\

\cvqual{no cv-qualifier}    &<& \tcode{const volatile}  \\
\tcode{const}               &<& \tcode{const volatile}  \\
\tcode{volatile}            &<& \tcode{const volatile}  \\
\end{floattable}

\pnum
In this International Standard, the notation \cv{} (or
\cvqual{cv1}, \cvqual{cv2}, etc.), used in the description of types,
represents an arbitrary set of cv-qualifiers, i.e., one of
\{\tcode{const}\}, \{\tcode{volatile}\}, \{\tcode{const},
\tcode{volatile}\}, or the empty set.
For a type \cv{} \tcode{T}, the \defnx{top-level cv-qualifiers}{cv-qualifier!top-level}
of that type are those denoted by \cv.
\begin{example}
The type corresponding to the \grammarterm{type-id}
\tcode{const int\&}
has no top-level cv-qualifiers.
The type corresponding to the \grammarterm{type-id}
\tcode{volatile int * const}
has the top-level cv-qualifier \tcode{const}.
For a class type \tcode{C},
the type corresponding to the \grammarterm{type-id}
\tcode{void (C::* volatile)(int) const}
has the top-level cv-qualifier \tcode{volatile}.
\end{example}

\pnum
Cv-qualifiers applied to an array
type attach to the underlying element type, so the notation
``\cv{} \tcode{T}'', where \tcode{T} is an array type, refers to
an array whose elements are so-qualified. An array type whose elements
are cv-qualified is also considered to have the same cv-qualifications
as its elements.%
\indextext{type|)}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
typedef char CA[5];
typedef const char CC;
CC arr1[5] = { 0 };
const CA arr2 = { 0 };
\end{codeblock}
The type of both \tcode{arr1} and \tcode{arr2} is ``array of 5
\tcode{const char}'', and the array type is considered to be
const-qualified.

\rSec1[basic.lval]{Lvalues and rvalues}
\pnum
Expressions are categorized according to the taxonomy in Figure~\ref{fig:categories}.

\begin{importgraphic}
{Expression category taxonomy}
{fig:categories}
{valuecategories.pdf}
\end{importgraphic}

\begin{itemize}
\item A \defn{glvalue} is an expression whose evaluation determines the identity of an object, bit-field, or function.
\item A \defn{prvalue} is an expression whose evaluation initializes an object or a bit-field,
or computes the value of the operand of an operator,
as specified by the context in which it appears.
\item An \defn{xvalue} is a glvalue that denotes an object or bit-field whose resources can be reused (usually because it is near the end of its lifetime).
\begin{example}
Certain kinds of expressions involving rvalue references~(\ref{dcl.ref}) yield xvalues,
such as a call to a function whose return type is an rvalue reference
or a cast to an rvalue reference type.
\end{example}
\item An \defn{lvalue} is a glvalue that is not an xvalue.
\item An \defn{rvalue} is a prvalue or an xvalue.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
Historically, lvalues and rvalues were so-called
because they could appear on the left- and right-hand side of an assignment
(although this is no longer generally true);
glvalues are ``generalized'' lvalues,
prvalues are ``pure'' rvalues,
and xvalues are ``eXpiring'' lvalues.
Despite their names, these terms classify expressions, not values.
\end{note}
Every expression belongs to exactly one of the fundamental classifications in this
taxonomy: lvalue, xvalue, or prvalue. This property of an expression is called
its \defn{value category}. \begin{note} The discussion of each built-in operator in
Clause~\ref{expr} indicates the category of the value it yields and the value categories
of the operands it expects. For example, the built-in assignment operators expect that
the left operand is an lvalue and that the right operand is a prvalue and yield an
lvalue as the result. User-defined operators are functions, and the categories of
values they expect and yield are determined by their parameter and return types. \end{note}

\pnum
The \defnx{result}{result!prvalue} of a prvalue
is the value that the expression stores into its context.
A prvalue whose result is the value \placeholder{V}
is sometimes said to have or name the value \placeholder{V}.
The \defn{result object} of a prvalue
is the object initialized by the prvalue;
a prvalue
that is used to compute the value of an operand of an operator or
that has type (possibly cv-qualified) \tcode{void}
has no result object.
\begin{note}
Except when the prvalue is the operand of a \grammarterm{decltype-specifier},
a prvalue of class or array type always has a result object.
For a discarded prvalue, a temporary object is materialized; see Clause~\ref{expr}.
\end{note}
The \defnx{result}{result!glvalue} of a glvalue is the entity denoted by the expression.

\pnum
\begin{note}
Whenever a glvalue appears in a context where a prvalue is expected, the glvalue is converted
to a prvalue; see~\ref{conv.lval}, \ref{conv.array},
and~\ref{conv.func}.
An attempt to bind an rvalue reference to an lvalue is not such a context; see~\ref{dcl.init.ref}.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
There are no prvalue bit-fields; if a bit-field is converted to a
prvalue~(\ref{conv.lval}), a prvalue of the type of the bit-field is
created, which might then be promoted~(\ref{conv.prom}).
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
Whenever a prvalue appears in a context where a glvalue is expected,
the prvalue is converted to an xvalue; see~\ref{conv.rval}.
\end{note}

\pnum
The discussion of reference initialization in~\ref{dcl.init.ref} and of
temporaries in~\ref{class.temporary} indicates the behavior of lvalues
and rvalues in other significant contexts.

\pnum
Unless otherwise indicated~(\ref{expr.call}),
a prvalue shall always have complete type or the \tcode{void} type.
A glvalue shall not have type \cv{} \tcode{void}.
\begin{note}
A glvalue may have complete or incomplete non-\tcode{void} type.
Class and array prvalues can have cv-qualified types; other prvalues
always have cv-unqualified types. See Clause~\ref{expr}.
\end{note}

\pnum
An lvalue is \defn{modifiable} unless its type is const-qualified
or is a function type.
\begin{note}
A program that attempts
to modify an object through a nonmodifiable lvalue expression or through an rvalue expression
is ill-formed~(\ref{expr.ass}, \ref{expr.post.incr}, \ref{expr.pre.incr}).
\end{note}

\pnum
If a program attempts to access the stored value of an object through a glvalue
of other than one of the following types the behavior is
undefined:\footnote{The intent of this list is to specify those circumstances in which an
object may or may not be aliased.}
\begin{itemize}
\item the dynamic type of the object,

\item a cv-qualified version of the dynamic type of the object,

\item a type similar (as defined in~\ref{conv.qual}) to the dynamic type
of the object,

\item a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the
dynamic type of the object,

\item a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to a
cv-qualified version of the dynamic type of the object,

\item an aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned types among its
elements or non-static data members (including, recursively, an element or non-static data member of a
subaggregate or contained union),

\item a type that is a (possibly cv-qualified) base class type of the dynamic type of
the object,

\item a \tcode{char} or \tcode{unsigned} \tcode{char} type.
\end{itemize}

\rSec1[basic.align]{Alignment}

\pnum
Object types have \defnx{alignment requirements}{alignment~requirement!implementation-defined} (\ref{basic.fundamental},~\ref{basic.compound})
which place restrictions on the addresses at which an object of that type
may be allocated. An \defn{alignment} is an \impldef{alignment}
integer value representing the number of bytes between successive addresses
at which a given object can be allocated. An object type imposes an alignment
requirement on every object of that type; stricter alignment can be requested
using the alignment specifier~(\ref{dcl.align}).

\pnum
\indextext{alignment!fundamental}%
A \defnx{fundamental alignment}{fundamental~alignment} is represented by an alignment
less than or equal to the greatest alignment supported by the implementation in
all contexts, which is equal to
\tcode{alignof(std::max_align_t)}~(\ref{support.types}).
The alignment required for a type might be different when it is used as the type
of a complete object and when it is used as the type of a subobject. \begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct B { long double d; };
struct D : virtual B { char c; };
\end{codeblock}

When \tcode{D} is the type of a complete object, it will have a subobject of
type \tcode{B}, so it must be aligned appropriately for a \tcode{long double}.
If \tcode{D} appears as a subobject of another object that also has \tcode{B}
as a virtual base class, the \tcode{B} subobject might be part of a different
subobject, reducing the alignment requirements on the \tcode{D} subobject.
\end{example} The result of the \tcode{alignof} operator reflects the alignment
requirement of the type in the complete-object case.

\pnum
\indextext{alignment!extended}%
\indextext{alignment!new-extended}%
\indextext{over-aligned~type}%
\indextext{type!over-aligned}%
An \defn{extended alignment} is represented by an alignment
greater than \tcode{alignof(std::max_align_t)}. It is \impldef{support for extended alignments}
whether any extended alignments are supported and the contexts in which they are
supported~(\ref{dcl.align}). A type having an extended alignment
requirement is an \grammarterm{over-aligned type}. \begin{note}
every over-aligned type is or contains a class type
to which extended alignment applies (possibly through a non-static data member).
\end{note}
A \defn{new-extended alignment} is represented by
an alignment greater than \mname{STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT}~(\ref{cpp.predefined}).

\pnum
Alignments are represented as values of the type \tcode{std::size_t}.
Valid alignments include only those values returned by an \tcode{alignof}
expression for the fundamental types plus an additional \impldef{alignment additional
values}
set of values, which may be empty.
Every alignment value shall be a non-negative integral power of two.

\pnum
Alignments have an order from \defnx{weaker}{alignment!weaker} to
\defnx{stronger}{alignment!stronger} or \defnx{stricter}{alignment!stricter} alignments. Stricter
alignments have larger alignment values. An address that satisfies an alignment
requirement also satisfies any weaker valid alignment requirement.

\pnum
The alignment requirement of a complete type can be queried using an
\tcode{alignof} expression~(\ref{expr.alignof}). Furthermore,
the narrow character types~(\ref{basic.fundamental}) shall have the weakest
alignment requirement.
\begin{note} This enables the narrow character types to be used as the
underlying type for an aligned memory area~(\ref{dcl.align}).\end{note}

\pnum
Comparing alignments is meaningful and provides the obvious results:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two alignments are equal when their numeric values are equal.
\item Two alignments are different when their numeric values are not equal.
\item When an alignment is larger than another it represents a stricter alignment.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\begin{note} The runtime pointer alignment function~(\ref{ptr.align})
can be used to obtain an aligned pointer within a buffer; the aligned-storage templates
in the library~(\ref{meta.trans.other}) can be used to obtain aligned storage.
\end{note}

\pnum
If a request for a specific extended alignment in a specific context is not
supported by an implementation, the program is ill-formed.
