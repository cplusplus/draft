\pnum
\begin{note} This Clause presents the basic concepts of the \Cpp{} language.
It explains the difference between an object and a
name and how they relate to the value categories for expressions.
It introduces the concepts of a
declaration and a definition and presents \Cpp{}'s
notion of type, scope, linkage, and
storage duration. The mechanisms for starting and
terminating a program are discussed. Finally, this Clause presents the
fundamental types of the language and lists the ways of constructing
compound types from these.\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note} This Clause does not cover concepts that affect only a single
part of the language. Such concepts are discussed in the relevant
Clauses. \end{note}

\indextext{region!declarative}%
An \defn{entity} is a value, object, reference,
structured binding,
function, enumerator, type,
class member, bit-field, template, template specialization, namespace, or
pack.

\pnum
A \defn{name} is a use of an \grammarterm{identifier}\iref{lex.name},
\grammarterm{operator-function-id}\iref{over.oper},
\grammarterm{literal-operator-id}\iref{over.literal},
\grammarterm{conversion-function-id}\iref{class.conv.fct}, or
\grammarterm{template-id}\iref{temp.names} that denotes an entity or
label~(\ref{stmt.goto}, \ref{stmt.label}).

\pnum
Every name that denotes an entity is introduced by a
\defn{declaration}. Every name that denotes a label is introduced
either by a \tcode{goto} statement\iref{stmt.goto} or a
\grammarterm{labeled-statement}\iref{stmt.label}.

\pnum
A \defn{variable} is introduced by the
declaration of
a reference other than a non-static data member or of
an object. The variable's name, if any, denotes the reference or object.

\pnum
A \defnadj{local}{entity} is a variable with
automatic storage duration\iref{basic.stc.auto},
a structured binding\iref{dcl.struct.bind}
whose corresponding variable is such an entity,
or the \tcode{*this} object\iref{expr.prim.this}.

\pnum
Some names denote types or templates. In general,
whenever a name is encountered it is necessary to determine whether that name denotes
one of these entities before continuing to parse the program that contains it. The
process that determines this is called
\defnx{name lookup}{lookup!name}\iref{basic.lookup}.

\pnum
Two names are \defnx{the same}{name!same} if
\begin{itemize}
\item they are \grammarterm{identifier}{s} composed of the same character sequence, or
\item they are \grammarterm{operator-function-id}{s} formed with
the same operator, or
\item they are \grammarterm{conversion-function-id}{s} formed
with the same type, or
\item they are \grammarterm{template-id}{s} that refer to the same class,
function, or variable\iref{temp.type}, or
\item they are the names of literal operators\iref{over.literal} formed with
the same literal suffix identifier.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\indextext{translation unit!name and}%
\indextext{linkage}%
A name used in more than one translation unit can potentially
refer to the same entity in these translation units depending on the
linkage\iref{basic.link} of the name specified in each
translation unit.

\rSec1[basic.def]{Declarations and definitions}

\pnum
\indextext{declaration!definition versus}%
\indextext{declaration}%
\indextext{declaration!name}%
A declaration\iref{dcl.dcl} may introduce
one or more names into a translation
unit or redeclare names introduced by previous declarations.
If so, the
declaration specifies the interpretation and attributes of these names.
A declaration may also have effects including:
\begin{itemize}
\item a static assertion\iref{dcl.dcl},
\item controlling template instantiation\iref{temp.explicit},
\item guiding template argument deduction for constructors\iref{temp.deduct.guide},
\item use of attributes\iref{dcl.dcl}, and
\item nothing (in the case of an \grammarterm{empty-declaration}).
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\indextext{declaration!function}%
\indextext{definition}%
Each entity declared by a \grammarterm{declaration} is
also \defnx{defined}{define} by that declaration unless:
\begin{itemize}
\item
it declares a function
without specifying the function's body\iref{dcl.fct.def},
\item
it contains
the
\indextext{declaration!\idxcode{extern}}%
\tcode{extern} specifier\iref{dcl.stc} or a
\grammarterm{linkage-specification}\footnote{Appearing inside the brace-enclosed
\grammarterm{declaration-seq} in a \grammarterm{linkage-specification} does
not affect whether a declaration is a definition.}\iref{dcl.link}
and neither an \grammarterm{initializer} nor a
\grammarterm{function-body},
\item
\indextext{declaration!static member@\tcode{static} member}%
it declares a non-inline static data member in a class
definition~(\ref{class.mem}, \ref{class.static}),
\item
it declares a static data member outside a class definition
and the variable was defined within the class with the \tcode{constexpr}
specifier (this usage is deprecated; see \ref{depr.static_constexpr}),
\item
\indextext{declaration!class name}%
it is introduced by an \grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier}\iref{class.name},
\item
it is an
\indextext{declaration!opaque enum}%
\grammarterm{opaque-enum-declaration}\iref{dcl.enum},
\item
it is a
\indextext{parameter!template}\indextext{template parameter}%
\grammarterm{template-parameter}\iref{temp.param},
\item
it is a
\indextext{declaration!parameter}\indextext{parameter declaration}%
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration}\iref{dcl.fct} in a function
\indextext{declarator}%
declarator that is not the \grammarterm{declarator} of a
\grammarterm{function-definition},
\item
it is a
\indextext{declaration!\idxcode{typedef}}%
\tcode{typedef} declaration\iref{dcl.typedef},
\item it is
an \grammarterm{alias-declaration}\iref{dcl.typedef},
\item it is
a
\grammarterm{using-declaration}\iref{namespace.udecl},
\item it is
a \grammarterm{deduction-guide}\iref{temp.deduct.guide},
\item it is
a \grammarterm{static_assert-declaration}\iref{dcl.dcl},
\item
it is an
\grammarterm{attribute-declaration}\iref{dcl.dcl},
\item
it is an
\grammarterm{empty-declaration}\iref{dcl.dcl},
\item it is
a \grammarterm{using-directive}\iref{namespace.udir},
\item it is
an explicit instantiation declaration\iref{temp.explicit}, or
\item it is
an explicit specialization\iref{temp.expl.spec} whose
\grammarterm{declaration} is not a definition.
\end{itemize}
A declaration is said to be a \defn{definition} of each entity that it defines.
\begin{example} All but one of the following are definitions:
\begin{codeblock}
int a;                          // defines \tcode{a}
extern const int c = 1;         // defines \tcode{c}
int f(int x) { return x+a; }    // defines \tcode{f} and defines \tcode{x}
struct S { int a; int b; };     // defines \tcode{S}, \tcode{S::a}, and \tcode{S::b}
struct X {                      // defines \tcode{X}
  int x;                        // defines non-static data member \tcode{x}
  static int y;                 // declares static data member \tcode{y}
  X(): x(0) { }                 // defines a constructor of \tcode{X}
};
int X::y = 1;                   // defines \tcode{X::y}
enum { up, down };              // defines \tcode{up} and \tcode{down}
namespace N { int d; }          // defines \tcode{N} and \tcode{N::d}
namespace N1 = N;               // defines \tcode{N1}
X anX;                          // defines \tcode{anX}

\end{codeblock}
whereas these are just declarations:
\begin{codeblock}
extern int a;                   // declares \tcode{a}
extern const int c;             // declares \tcode{c}
int f(int);                     // declares \tcode{f}
struct S;                       // declares \tcode{S}
typedef int Int;                // declares \tcode{Int}
extern X anotherX;              // declares \tcode{anotherX}
using N::d;                     // declares \tcode{d}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
\indextext{implementation-generated}%
In some circumstances, \Cpp{} implementations implicitly define the
default constructor\iref{class.default.ctor},
copy constructor, move constructor\iref{class.copy.ctor},
copy assignment operator, move assignment operator\iref{class.copy.assign},
or destructor\iref{class.dtor} member functions.
\end{note}
\begin{example} Given
\begin{codeblock}
#include <string>

struct C {
  std::string s;                // \tcode{std::string} is the standard library class\iref{strings}
};

int main() {
  C a;
  C b = a;
  b = a;
}
\end{codeblock}
the implementation will implicitly define functions to make the
definition of \tcode{C} equivalent to
\begin{codeblock}
struct C {
  std::string s;
  C() : s() { }
  C(const C& x): s(x.s) { }
  C(C&& x): s(static_cast<std::string&&>(x.s)) { }
      @\rlap{\normalfont\itshape //}@    : s(std::move(x.s)) { }
  C& operator=(const C& x) { s = x.s; return *this; }
  C& operator=(C&& x) { s = static_cast<std::string&&>(x.s); return *this; }
      @\rlap{\normalfont\itshape //}@                { s = std::move(x.s); return *this; }
  ~C() { }
};
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
A class name can also be implicitly declared by an

\pnum
\indextext{type!incomplete}%
In the definition of an object,
the type of that object shall not be

\pnum
\indextext{expression!potentially evaluated}%
An expression is \defn{potentially evaluated} unless it is an
unevaluated operand\iref{expr.prop} or a subexpression thereof.
The set of \defn{potential results} of an expression \tcode{e} is
defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{e} is an
\grammarterm{id-expression}\iref{expr.prim.id}, the set
contains only \tcode{e}.
\item If \tcode{e} is a subscripting operation\iref{expr.sub} with
an array operand, the set contains the potential results of that operand.
\item If \tcode{e} is a class member access
expression\iref{expr.ref}, the set contains the potential results of
the object expression.
\item If \tcode{e} is a pointer-to-member
expression\iref{expr.mptr.oper} whose second operand is a constant
expression, the set contains the potential results of the object
expression.
\item If \tcode{e} has the form \tcode{(e1)}, the set contains the
potential results of \tcode{e1}.
\item If \tcode{e} is a glvalue conditional
expression\iref{expr.cond}, the set is the union of the sets of
potential results of the second and third operands.
\item If \tcode{e} is a comma expression\iref{expr.comma}, the set
contains the potential results of the right operand.
\item Otherwise, the set is empty.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
This set is a (possibly-empty) set of \grammarterm{id-expression}{s},
each of which is either \tcode{e} or a subexpression of \tcode{e}.
\begin{example}
In the following example, the set of potential results of the initializer
of \tcode{n} contains the first \tcode{S::x} subexpression, but not the second
\tcode{S::x} subexpression.
\begin{codeblock}
struct S { static const int x = 0; };
const int &f(const int &r);
int n = b ? (1, S::x)           // \tcode{S::x} is not odr-used here
          : f(S::x);            // \tcode{S::x} is odr-used here, so a definition is required
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{function!named by an expression}%
A function is \defn{named by an expression} as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  A function whose name appears in an expression
  is named by that expression
  if it is the unique lookup result or the selected member
  of a set of overloaded functions~(\ref{basic.lookup}, \ref{over.match}, \ref{over.over}),
  unless it is a pure virtual function and either
  its name is not explicitly qualified or
  the expression forms a pointer to member\iref{expr.unary.op}.
  \begin{note} This covers
  taking the address of functions~(\ref{conv.func}, \ref{expr.unary.op}),
  calls to named functions\iref{expr.call},
  operator overloading\iref{over},
  user-defined conversions\iref{class.conv.fct},
  allocation functions for placement \grammarterm{new-expression}{s}\iref{expr.new}, as well as
  non-default initialization\iref{dcl.init}.
  A constructor selected to copy or move an object of class type
  is considered to be named by an expression
  even if the call is actually elided by the implementation\iref{class.copy.elision}. \end{note}
\item
  An allocation or deallocation function for a class
  is named by a \grammarterm{new-expression}
  as specified in~\ref{expr.new} and~\ref{class.free}.
\item
  A deallocation function for a class
  is named by a delete expression
  as specified in~\ref{expr.delete} and~\ref{class.free}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
A variable \tcode{x} whose name appears as a
potentially-evaluated expression \tcode{ex} is \defnx{odr-used}{odr-use} by \tcode{ex} unless
applying the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion\iref{conv.lval} to \tcode{x} yields
a constant expression\iref{expr.const}
that does not invoke a function
other than a trivial special member function\iref{special}
and, if \tcode{x} is an object, \tcode{ex} is an element of
the set of potential results of an expression \tcode{e}, where either the lvalue-to-rvalue
conversion\iref{conv.lval} is applied to \tcode{e}, or \tcode{e} is
a discarded-value expression\iref{expr.prop}.

\pnum
A structured binding is odr-used if it appears as a potentially-evaluated expression.

\pnum
\tcode{*this} is odr-used if \tcode{this} appears as a potentially-evaluated expression
(including as the result of the implicit transformation in the body of a non-static
member function~(\ref{class.mfct.non-static})).

\pnum
A virtual member
function is odr-used if it is not pure.
A function is odr-used if it is named by a potentially-evaluated expression.
A non-placement allocation or deallocation
function for a class is odr-used by the definition of a constructor of that
class. A non-placement deallocation function for a class is odr-used by the
definition of the destructor of that class, or by being selected by the
lookup at the point of definition of a virtual
destructor\iref{class.dtor}.\footnote{An implementation is not required
to call allocation and
deallocation functions from constructors or destructors; however, this
is a permissible implementation technique.}

\pnum
An assignment operator function in a class is odr-used by an
implicitly-defined
copy-assignment or move-assignment function for another class as specified
in~\ref{class.copy.assign}.
A constructor for a class is odr-used as specified
in~\ref{dcl.init}. A destructor for a class is odr-used if it is potentially
invoked\iref{class.dtor}.

\pnum
A local entity\iref{basic}
is \defn{odr-usable} in a declarative region\iref{basic.scope.declarative} if:

\begin{itemize}
\item the local entity is either
not \tcode{*this}, or
an enclosing class or non-lambda function parameter scope exists and,
if the innermost such scope is a function parameter scope,
it corresponds to a non-static member function, and
\item
for each intervening declarative region\iref{basic.scope.declarative}
between the point at which the entity is introduced and the region
(where \tcode{*this} is considered to be introduced
within the innermost enclosing class or non-lambda function definition scope),
either:
\begin{itemize}
\item the intervening declarative region is a block scope, or
\item the intervening declarative region is the function parameter scope of a \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
that has a \grammarterm{simple-capture} naming the entity or has a \grammarterm{capture-default}.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If a local entity is odr-used
in a declarative region in which it is not odr-usable,
the program is ill-formed.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void f(int n) {
  [] { n = 1; };                // error, \tcode{n} is not odr-usable due to intervening lambda-expression
  struct A {
    void f() { n = 2; }         // error, \tcode{n} is not odr-usable due to intervening function definition scope
  };
  void g(int = n);              // error, \tcode{n} is not odr-usable due to intervening function parameter scope
  [&] { [n]{ return n; }; };    // OK
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
Every program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline
function or variable that is odr-used in that program
outside of a discarded statement\iref{stmt.if}; no diagnostic required.
The definition can appear explicitly in the program, it can be found in
the standard or a user-defined library, or (when appropriate) it is
implicitly defined (see~\ref{class.default.ctor}, \ref{class.copy.ctor},
\ref{class.dtor}, and \ref{class.copy.assign}).
An inline function or variable shall be defined in every
translation unit in which it is odr-used outside of a discarded statement.

\pnum
\indextext{type!incomplete}%
Exactly one definition of a class is required in a translation unit if
the class is used in a way that requires the class type to be complete.
\begin{example} The following complete translation unit is well-formed,
even though it never defines \tcode{X}:

\begin{codeblock}
struct X;                       // declare \tcode{X} as a struct type
struct X* x1;                   // use \tcode{X} in pointer formation
X* x2;                          // use \tcode{X} in pointer formation
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note} The rules for declarations and expressions
describe in which contexts complete class types are required. A class
type \tcode{T} must be complete if:
\begin{itemize}
\item an object of type \tcode{T} is defined\iref{basic.def}, or
\item a non-static class data member of type \tcode{T} is
declared\iref{class.mem}, or
\item \tcode{T} is used as the allocated type or array element type in a
\grammarterm{new-expression}\iref{expr.new}, or
\item an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to
a glvalue referring
to an object of type \tcode{T}\iref{conv.lval}, or
\item an expression is converted (either implicitly or explicitly) to
type \tcode{T} (\ref{conv}, \ref{expr.type.conv},
\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}, \ref{expr.static.cast}, \ref{expr.cast}), or
\item an expression that is not a null pointer constant, and has type
other than \cv{}~\tcode{void*}, is converted to the type pointer to \tcode{T}
or reference to \tcode{T} using a standard conversion\iref{conv},
a \tcode{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast} or
a \tcode{static_cast}\iref{expr.static.cast}, or
\item a class member access operator is applied to an expression of type
\tcode{T}\iref{expr.ref}, or
\item the \tcode{typeid} operator\iref{expr.typeid} or the
\tcode{sizeof} operator\iref{expr.sizeof} is applied to an operand of
type \tcode{T}, or
\item a function with a return type or argument type of type \tcode{T}
is defined\iref{basic.def} or called\iref{expr.call}, or
\item a class with a base class of type \tcode{T} is
defined\iref{class.derived}, or
\item an lvalue of type \tcode{T} is assigned to\iref{expr.ass}, or
\item the type \tcode{T} is the subject of an
\tcode{alignof} expression\iref{expr.alignof}, or
\item an \grammarterm{exception-declaration} has type \tcode{T}, reference to
\tcode{T}, or pointer to \tcode{T}\iref{except.handle}.
\end{itemize}
\end{note}

\pnum
There can be more than one definition of a class type\iref{class},
enumeration type\iref{dcl.enum}, inline function
with external linkage\iref{dcl.inline}, inline variable with external
linkage\iref{dcl.inline}, class template\iref{temp},
non-static function template\iref{temp.fct},
concept\iref{temp.concept},
static data member of a class template\iref{temp.static}, member
function of a class template\iref{temp.mem.func}, or template
specialization for which some template parameters are not
specified~(\ref{temp.spec}, \ref{temp.class.spec}) in a program provided
that each definition appears in a different translation unit, and
provided the definitions satisfy the following requirements. Given such
an entity named \tcode{D} defined in more than one translation unit,
then
\begin{itemize}
\item each definition of \tcode{D} shall consist of the same sequence of
tokens; and
\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, corresponding names, looked up
according to~\ref{basic.lookup}, shall refer to an entity defined within
the definition of \tcode{D}, or shall refer to the same entity, after
overload resolution\iref{over.match} and after matching of partial
template specialization\iref{temp.over}, except that a name can refer to
\begin{itemize}
\item
a non-volatile const object with internal or no linkage if the object
\begin{itemize}
\item has the same literal type in all definitions of \tcode{D},
\item is initialized with a constant expression\iref{expr.const},
\item is not odr-used in any definition of \tcode{D}, and
\item has the same value in all definitions of \tcode{D},
\end{itemize}
or
\item
a reference with internal or no linkage
initialized with a constant expression such that
the reference refers to the same entity in all definitions of \tcode{D};
\end{itemize}
and

\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, corresponding entities shall have the
same language linkage; and

\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, the overloaded operators referred
to, the implicit calls to conversion functions, constructors, operator
new functions and operator delete functions, shall refer to the same
function, or to a function defined within the definition of \tcode{D};
and

\item in each definition of \tcode{D}, a default argument used by an
(implicit or explicit) function call is treated as if its token sequence
were present in the definition of \tcode{D}; that is, the default
argument is subject to the requirements described in this paragraph (and, if
the default argument has subexpressions with default arguments, this
requirement applies recursively)\footnote{\ref{dcl.fct.default}
describes how default argument names are looked up.}; and

\item if \tcode{D} invokes a function with a precondition,
or is a function
that contains an assertion or has a contract condition\iref{dcl.attr.contract},
it is \impldef{consistency of build level and violation continuation mode}
under which conditions all definitions of \tcode{D}
shall be translated using the same build level
and violation continuation mode; and

\item if \tcode{D} is a class with an implicitly-declared
constructor (\ref{class.default.ctor}, \ref{class.copy.ctor}),
it is as if the constructor was
implicitly defined in every translation unit where it is odr-used, and the
implicit definition in every translation unit shall call the same
constructor for a subobject of \tcode{D}.
\begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
// translation unit 1:
struct X {
  X(int, int);
  X(int, int, int);
};
X::X(int, int = 0) { }
class D {
  X x = 0;
};
D d1;                           // \tcode{X(int, int)} called by \tcode{D()}

// translation unit 2:
struct X {
  X(int, int);
  X(int, int, int);
};
X::X(int, int = 0, int = 0) { }
class D {
  X x = 0;
};
D d2;                           // \tcode{X(int, int, int)} called by \tcode{D()};
                                // \tcode{D()}'s implicit definition violates the ODR
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{itemize}
If \tcode{D} is a template and is defined in more than one
translation unit, then the preceding requirements
shall apply both to names from the template's enclosing scope used in the
template definition\iref{temp.nondep}, and also to dependent names at
the point of instantiation\iref{temp.dep}. If the definitions of
\tcode{D} satisfy all these requirements, then the behavior is
as if there were a single definition of \tcode{D}.
\begin{note}
The entity is still declared in multiple translation units, and \ref{basic.link}
still applies to these declarations. In particular,

Every name is introduced in some portion of program text called a
\indextext{region!declarative}%
\indextext{scope!potential}%
\defn{declarative region}, which is the largest part of the program
in which that name is valid, that is, in which that name may
be used as an unqualified name to refer to the same entity. In general,
each particular name is valid only within some possibly discontiguous
portion of program text called its \defn{scope}. To determine the
scope of a declaration, it is sometimes convenient to refer to the
\defn{potential scope} of a declaration. The scope of a declaration
is the same as its potential scope unless the potential scope contains
another declaration of the same name. In that case, the potential scope
of the declaration in the inner (contained) declarative region is
excluded from the scope of the declaration in the outer (containing)
declarative region.

\begin{codeblock}

the identifier \tcode{j} is declared twice as a name (and used twice).
The declarative region of the first \tcode{j} includes the entire
example. The potential scope of the first \tcode{j} begins immediately
after that \tcode{j} and extends to the end of the program, but its

\tcode{j} (the \tcode{j} immediately before the semicolon) includes all
the text between \tcode{\{} and \tcode{\}}, but its potential scope
excludes the declaration of \tcode{i}. The scope of the second
declaration of \tcode{j} is the same as its potential scope.

The declarative region of the name of a template parameter of a template is the smallest
\grammarterm{template-declaration} in which the name was introduced. Only template
parameter names belong to this declarative region; any other kind of name introduced by
the \grammarterm{declaration} of a \grammarterm{template-declaration} is instead
introduced into the same declarative region where it would be introduced as a result of
a non-template declaration of the same name. \begin{example}

the same declarative region --- namely, the \grammarterm{namespace-body} of \tcode{N}.
(\tcode{g} is still considered to belong to this declarative region in spite of its
being hidden during qualified and unqualified name lookup.)
\end{example}

\pnum
The potential scope of a template parameter name begins at its point of
declaration\iref{basic.scope.pdecl} and ends at the end of its declarative region.

declaration of subsequent \grammarterm{template-parameter}{s} and their default
arguments but cannot be used in preceding \grammarterm{template-parameter}{s} or their
default arguments. For example,

\begin{codeblock}
template<class T, T* p, class U = T> class X { @\commentellip@ };
template<class T> void f(T* p = new T);
\end{codeblock}

This also implies that a \grammarterm{template-parameter} can be used in the
specification of base classes. For example,

\begin{codeblock}
template<class T> class X : public Array<T> { @\commentellip@ };
template<class T> class Y : public T { @\commentellip@ };
\end{codeblock}

The use of a template parameter as a base class implies that a class used as a template
argument must be defined and not just declared when the class template is instantiated.

\pnum
The declarative region of the name of a template parameter is nested within the
immediately-enclosing declarative region. \begin{note} As a result, a

\begin{codeblock}
typedef int N;

non-type template parameter of the same type as the second template parameter of
\tcode{A}. \end{example}\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note} Because the name of a template parameter cannot be redeclared within its

such names in the context discussed by a particular rule. Name lookup
associates the use of a name with a set of declarations\iref{basic.def} of
that name.
The declarations found by name lookup shall either all denote the same entity or

in the latter case,
the declarations are said to form a set of overloaded

In all the cases listed in~\ref{basic.lookup.unqual}, the scopes are

name. If no declaration is found, the program is ill-formed.

\pnum
The declarations from the namespace nominated by a
\grammarterm{using-directive} become visible in a namespace enclosing the
\grammarterm{using-directive}; see~\ref{namespace.udir}. For the purpose of
the unqualified name lookup rules described
in~\ref{basic.lookup.unqual}, the declarations from the namespace
nominated by the \grammarterm{using-directive} are considered members of
that enclosing namespace.

\pnum
The lookup for an unqualified name used as the
\grammarterm{postfix-expression} of a function call is described
in~\ref{basic.lookup.argdep}. \begin{note} For purposes of determining
(during parsing) whether an expression is a
\grammarterm{postfix-expression} for a function call, the usual name lookup
rules apply.
In some cases
a name followed by \tcode{<} is treated as a \grammarterm{template-name}
even though name lookup did not find a \grammarterm{template-name}
(see \ref{temp.names}).
For example,
\begin{codeblock}
int h;
void g();
namespace N {
  struct A {};
  template <class T> int f(T);
  template <class T> int g(T);
  template <class T> int h(T);
}

int x = f<N::A>(N::A());        // OK: lookup of \tcode{f} finds nothing, \tcode{f} treated as template name
int y = g<N::A>(N::A());        // OK: lookup of \tcode{g} finds a function, \tcode{g} treated as template name
int z = h<N::A>(N::A());        // error: \tcode{h<} does not begin a \grammarterm{template-id}
\end{codeblock}

The rules in~\ref{basic.lookup.argdep} have no effect on
the syntactic interpretation of an expression. For example,

\begin{codeblock}
typedef int f;
namespace N {
  struct A {
    friend void f(A &);
    operator int();
    void g(A a) {
      int i = f(a);             // \tcode{f} is the typedef, not the friend function: equivalent to \tcode{int(a)}
    }
  };
}
\end{codeblock}

Because the expression is not a function call, the argument-dependent
name lookup\iref{basic.lookup.argdep} does not apply and the friend
function \tcode{f} is not found. \end{note}

When the \grammarterm{postfix-expression} in

searched, and in those namespaces, namespace-scope friend function or
function template declarations\iref{class.friend} not otherwise

These modifications to the search depend on the types of the arguments
(and for template template arguments, the namespace of the template

For each argument type \tcode{T} in the function call, there is a set of
zero or more \defnx{associated namespaces}{namespace!associated}
and a set of zero or more \defnx{associated classes}{class!associated}
to be considered. The sets of namespaces and classes are
determined entirely by the types of the function arguments (and the
namespace of any template template argument). Typedef names and
\grammarterm{using-declaration}{s} used to specify the types do not
contribute to this set. The sets of namespaces and classes are
determined in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{T} is a fundamental type, its associated sets of
namespaces and classes are both empty.

\item If \tcode{T} is a class type (including unions), its associated
classes are: the class itself; the class of which it is a member, if
any; and its direct and indirect base classes. Its associated namespaces
are the innermost enclosing namespaces of its associated classes.
Furthermore, if \tcode{T} is a class template specialization, its
associated namespaces and classes also include: the namespaces and
classes associated with the types of the template arguments provided for
template type parameters (excluding template template parameters); the
namespaces of which any template template arguments are members; and the
classes of which any member templates used as template template
arguments are members. \begin{note} Non-type template arguments do not
contribute to the set of associated namespaces.\end{note}

\item If \tcode{T} is an enumeration type, its associated namespace is
the innermost enclosing namespace of its declaration. If it is a class member, its
associated class is the member's class; else it has no associated class.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to \tcode{U} or an array of \tcode{U},
its associated namespaces and classes are those associated with
\tcode{U}.

\item If \tcode{T} is a function type, its associated namespaces and
classes are those associated with the function parameter types and those
associated with the return type.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a member function of a class
\tcode{X}, its associated namespaces and classes are those associated
with the function parameter types and return type, together with those
associated with \tcode{X}.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a data member of class \tcode{X}, its
associated namespaces and classes are those associated with the member
type together with those associated with \tcode{X}.
\end{itemize}
If an associated namespace is an inline namespace\iref{namespace.def}, its
enclosing namespace is also included in the set. If an associated namespace
directly contains inline namespaces, those inline namespaces are also included
in the set.
In addition, if the argument is the name or address of a set of
overloaded functions and/or function templates, its associated classes
and namespaces are the union of those associated with each of the
members of the set, i.e., the classes and namespaces associated with its
parameter types and return type.
Additionally, if the aforementioned set of overloaded functions is named with
a \grammarterm{template-id}, its associated classes and namespaces also include
those of its type \grammarterm{template-argument}{s} and its template
\grammarterm{template-argument}{s}.

\pnum
Let \placeholder{X} be the lookup set produced by unqualified
lookup\iref{basic.lookup.unqual} and let \placeholder{Y} be the lookup set produced

\item a declaration of a class member, or
\item a block-scope function declaration that is not a \grammarterm{using-declaration}, or
\item a declaration that is neither a function nor a function template
\end{itemize}
then \placeholder{Y} is empty. Otherwise \placeholder{Y} is the set of declarations
found in the namespaces associated with the argument types as described
below. The set of declarations found by the lookup of the name is the
union of \placeholder{X} and \placeholder{Y}. \begin{note} The namespaces and classes
associated with the argument types can include namespaces and classes
already considered by the ordinary unqualified lookup. \end{note}

\pnum
The name of a function declared in block scope and the name of a variable declared by a
block scope \tcode{extern} declaration have linkage. If there is a visible declaration
of an entity with linkage having the same name and type, ignoring entities declared
outside the innermost enclosing namespace scope, the block scope declaration declares
that same entity and receives the linkage of the previous declaration. If there is more
than one such matching entity, the program is ill-formed. Otherwise, if no matching
entity is found, the block scope entity receives external linkage.
If, within a translation unit, the same entity is declared with both
internal and external linkage, the program is ill-formed.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
static void f();
static int i = 0;               // \#1

    extern int i;               // \#3: external linkage, ill-formed
  }
}
\end{codeblock}

Without the declaration at line \#2,
the declaration at line \#3 would link with the declaration at line \#1.
Because the declaration with internal linkage is hidden, however,
\#3 is given external linkage, making the program ill-formed.
\end{example}

when implicitly changing the active member of a union\iref{class.union},
or
when a temporary object is created~(\ref{conv.rval}, \ref{class.temporary}).
An object occupies a region of storage

\begin{note} A function is not an object, regardless of whether or not it

\item
the new object is of the same type as \placeholder{e} (ignoring cv-qualification).

\rSec2[basic.life]{Object lifetime}

\pnum
\indextext{object lifetime|(}%
The \defn{lifetime} of an object or reference is a runtime property of the
object or reference.
An object is said to have \defnadj{non-vacuous}{initialization} if it is of a class or
array type and it or one of its subobjects is initialized by a constructor
other than a trivial default constructor. \begin{note} Initialization by a
trivial copy/move constructor is non-vacuous initialization. \end{note}
The lifetime of an object of type \tcode{T} begins when:
\begin{itemize}
\item storage with the proper alignment and size for type \tcode{T} is
obtained, and
\item if the object has non-vacuous initialization, its initialization is complete,
\end{itemize}
except that if the object is a union member or subobject thereof,
its lifetime only begins if that union member is the
initialized member in the union~(\ref{dcl.init.aggr}, \ref{class.base.init}),
or as described in \ref{class.union}.
The lifetime of an object \placeholder{o} of type \tcode{T} ends when:
\begin{itemize}
\item if \tcode{T} is a class type with a non-trivial
destructor\iref{class.dtor}, the destructor call starts, or
\item the storage which the object occupies is released,
or is reused by an object that is not nested within \placeholder{o}\iref{intro.object}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The lifetime of a reference begins when its initialization is complete.
The lifetime of a reference ends as if it were a scalar object.

\pnum
\begin{note} \ref{class.base.init}
describes the lifetime of base and member subobjects. \end{note}

\pnum
The properties ascribed to objects and references throughout this document
apply for a given object or reference only during its lifetime. \begin{note}
In particular, before the lifetime of an object starts and after its
lifetime ends there are significant restrictions on the use of the
object, as described below, in~\ref{class.base.init} and
in~\ref{class.cdtor}. Also, the behavior of an object under construction
and destruction might not be the same as the behavior of an object whose
lifetime has started and not ended. \ref{class.base.init}
and~\ref{class.cdtor} describe the behavior of objects during the
construction and destruction phases. \end{note}

\pnum
A program may end the lifetime of any object by reusing the storage
which the object occupies or by explicitly calling the destructor for an
object of a class type with a non-trivial destructor. For an object of a
class type with a non-trivial destructor, the program is not required to
call the destructor explicitly before the storage which the object
occupies is reused or released; however, if there is no explicit call to
the destructor or if a \grammarterm{delete-expression}\iref{expr.delete}
is not used to release the storage, the destructor shall not be
implicitly called and any program that depends on the side effects
produced by the destructor has undefined behavior.

\pnum
Before the lifetime of an object has started but after the storage which
the object will occupy has been allocated\footnote{For example, before the
construction of a global object
that is initialized via a user-provided constructor\iref{class.cdtor}.}
or, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage
which the object occupied is reused or released, any pointer that represents the address of
the storage location where the object will be or was located may be
used but only in limited ways.
For an object under construction or destruction, see~\ref{class.cdtor}.
Otherwise, such
a pointer refers to allocated
storage\iref{basic.stc.dynamic.allocation}, and using the pointer as
if the pointer were of type \tcode{void*}, is
well-defined. Indirection through such a pointer is permitted but the resulting lvalue may only be used in
limited ways, as described below. The
program has undefined behavior if:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  the object will be or was of a class type with a non-trivial destructor
  and the pointer is used as the operand of a \grammarterm{delete-expression},
\item
  the pointer is used to access a non-static data member or call a
  non-static member function of the object, or
\item
  the pointer is implicitly converted\iref{conv.ptr} to a pointer
  to a virtual base class, or
\item
  the pointer is used as the operand of a
  \tcode{static_cast}\iref{expr.static.cast}, except when the conversion
  is to pointer to \cv{}~\tcode{void}, or to pointer to \cv{}~\tcode{void}
  and subsequently to pointer to
  \cv{}~\tcode{char},
  \cv{}~\tcode{unsigned char}, or
  \cv{}~\tcode{std::byte}\iref{cstddef.syn}, or
\item
  the pointer is used as the operand of a
  \tcode{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast}.

struct D1 : B { void f(); };
struct D2 : B { void f(); };

  f();              // undefined behavior
  ... = this;       // OK, \tcode{this} points to valid memory

  void* q = pb;     // OK: \tcode{pb} points to valid memory
  pb->f();          // undefined behavior, lifetime of \tcode{*pb} has ended
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
Similarly, before the lifetime of an object has started but after the
storage which the object will occupy has been allocated or, after the
lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which the object
occupied is reused or released, any glvalue that refers to the original
object may be used but only in limited ways.
For an object under construction or destruction, see~\ref{class.cdtor}.
Otherwise, such
a glvalue refers to
allocated storage\iref{basic.stc.dynamic.allocation}, and using the
properties of the glvalue that do not depend on its value is
well-defined. The program has undefined behavior if:
\begin{itemize}
\item the glvalue is used to access the object, or
\item the glvalue is used to call a non-static member function of the object, or
\item the glvalue is bound to a reference to a virtual base class\iref{dcl.init.ref}, or
\item the glvalue is used as the operand of a
\tcode{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast} or as the operand of
\tcode{typeid}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
If, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage
which the object occupied is reused or released, a new object is created
at the storage location which the original object occupied, a pointer
that pointed to the original object, a reference that referred to the
original object, or the name of the original object will automatically
refer to the new object and, once the lifetime of the new object has
started, can be used to manipulate the new object, if:
\begin{itemize}
\item the storage for the new object exactly overlays the storage
location which the original object occupied, and

\item the new object is of the same type as the original object
(ignoring the top-level cv-qualifiers), and

\item the type of the original object is not const-qualified, and, if a
class type, does not contain any non-static data member whose type is
const-qualified or a reference type, and

\item neither the original object nor the new object
is a potentially-overlapping subobject\iref{intro.object}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct C {
  int i;
  void f();
  const C& operator=( const C& );
};

const C& C::operator=( const C& other) {
  if ( this != &other ) {
    this->~C();                 // lifetime of \tcode{*this} ends
    new (this) C(other);        // new object of type \tcode{C} created
    f();                        // well-defined
  }
  return *this;
}

C c1;
C c2;
c1 = c2;                        // well-defined
c1.f();                         // well-defined; \tcode{c1} refers to a new object of type \tcode{C}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
If these conditions are not met,
a pointer to the new object can be obtained from
a pointer that represents the address of its storage
by calling \tcode{std::launder}\iref{support.dynamic}.

If a program ends the lifetime of an object of type \tcode{T} with
static\iref{basic.stc.static}, thread\iref{basic.stc.thread},

implicitly---upon exit from the block for an object with
automatic storage duration, upon exit from the thread for an object with
thread storage duration, or upon exit from the program for an object
with static storage duration.}
the program must ensure that an object of the original type occupies
that same storage location when the implicit destructor call takes
place; otherwise the behavior of the program is undefined. This is true
even if the block is exited with an exception. \begin{example}

\begin{codeblock}
class T { };

\pnum
Creating a new object within the storage that a const complete
object with static, thread, or automatic storage duration occupies,
or within the storage that such a const object used to occupy before
its lifetime ended, results in undefined behavior.

In this subclause, ``before'' and ``after'' refer to the ``happens before''

The storage duration categories apply to references as well.

\pnum
When the end of the duration of a region of storage is reached,

Indirection through an invalid pointer value and

Any other use of an invalid pointer value has
\impldef{any use of an invalid pointer other than to perform indirection or deallocate}

An allocation function shall be a class member function or a global

in a namespace scope other than global scope or declared static in
global scope. The return type shall be \tcode{void*}. The first
parameter shall have type \tcode{std::size_t}\iref{support.types}. The
first parameter shall not have an associated default
argument\iref{dcl.fct.default}. The value of the first parameter
is interpreted as the requested size of the allocation. An allocation
function can be a function template. Such a template shall declare its
return type and first parameter as specified above (that is, template
parameter types shall not be used in the return type and first parameter
type). Template allocation functions shall have two or more parameters.

\pnum
An allocation function attempts to allocate the requested amount of
storage. If it is successful, it returns the address of the start
of a block of storage whose length in bytes is at least as large
as the requested size.
The order,
contiguity, and initial value of storage allocated by successive calls
to an allocation function are unspecified.
For an allocation function other than
a reserved placement allocation function\iref{new.delete.placement},
the pointer returned is
suitably aligned so that it can be converted to a pointer to any
suitable complete object type\iref{new.delete.single}
and then used to access the object or array in the
storage allocated (until the storage is explicitly deallocated by a call
to a corresponding deallocation function). Even if the size of the space
requested is zero, the request can fail. If the request succeeds, the
value returned by a replaceable allocation function
is a non-null pointer value\iref{conv.ptr}
\tcode{p0} different from any previously returned value \tcode{p1},
unless that value \tcode{p1} was subsequently passed to a
replaceable deallocation function.
Furthermore, for the library allocation functions

An allocation function that has a non-throwing

\pnum
Object types have \defnx{alignment requirements}{alignment requirement!implementation-defined}~(\ref{basic.fundamental}, \ref{basic.compound})
which place restrictions on the addresses at which an object of that type
may be allocated. An \defn{alignment} is an \impldef{alignment}
integer value representing the number of bytes between successive addresses
at which a given object can be allocated. An object type imposes an alignment
requirement on every object of that type; stricter alignment can be requested
using the alignment specifier\iref{dcl.align}.

\pnum
\indextext{alignment!fundamental}%
A \defn{fundamental alignment} is represented by an alignment
less than or equal to the greatest alignment supported by the implementation in
all contexts, which is equal to
\tcode{alignof(std::max_align_t)}\iref{support.types}.
The alignment required for a type might be different when it is used as the type
of a complete object and when it is used as the type of a subobject. \begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct B { long double d; };
struct D : virtual B { char c; };
\end{codeblock}

When \tcode{D} is the type of a complete object, it will have a subobject of
type \tcode{B}, so it must be aligned appropriately for a \tcode{long double}.
If \tcode{D} appears as a subobject of another object that also has \tcode{B}
as a virtual base class, the \tcode{B} subobject might be part of a different
subobject, reducing the alignment requirements on the \tcode{D} subobject.
\end{example} The result of the \tcode{alignof} operator reflects the alignment
requirement of the type in the complete-object case.

\pnum

whether any extended alignments are supported and the contexts in which they are
supported\iref{dcl.align}. A type having an extended alignment
requirement is an \defnadj{over-aligned}{type}. \begin{note}
Every over-aligned type is or contains a class type
to which extended alignment applies (possibly through a non-static data member).
\end{note}
A \defn{new-extended alignment} is represented by
an alignment greater than \mname{STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT}\iref{cpp.predefined}.

\pnum
Alignments are represented as values of the type \tcode{std::size_t}.
Valid alignments include only those values returned by an \tcode{alignof}
expression for the fundamental types plus an additional \impldef{alignment additional

set of values, which may be empty.
Every alignment value shall be a non-negative integral power of two.

\pnum
Alignments have an order from \defnx{weaker}{alignment!weaker} to
\defnx{stronger}{alignment!stronger} or \defnx{stricter}{alignment!stricter} alignments. Stricter
alignments have larger alignment values. An address that satisfies an alignment
requirement also satisfies any weaker valid alignment requirement.

\pnum
The alignment requirement of a complete type can be queried using an
\tcode{alignof} expression\iref{expr.alignof}. Furthermore,
the narrow character types\iref{basic.fundamental} shall have the weakest
alignment requirement.
\begin{note} This enables the narrow character types to be used as the
underlying type for an aligned memory area\iref{dcl.align}.\end{note}

\pnum
Comparing alignments is meaningful and provides the obvious results:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two alignments are equal when their numeric values are equal.
\item Two alignments are different when their numeric values are not equal.
\item When an alignment is larger than another it represents a stricter alignment.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\begin{note} The runtime pointer alignment function\iref{ptr.align}
can be used to obtain an aligned pointer within a buffer; the aligned-storage templates
in the library\iref{meta.trans.other} can be used to obtain aligned storage.
\end{note}

If a request for a specific extended alignment in a specific context is not
supported by an implementation, the program is ill-formed.

\end{note}

\pnum
The materialization of a temporary object is generally
delayed as long as possible
in order to avoid creating unnecessary temporary objects.
\begin{note}
Temporary objects are materialized:
\begin{itemize}
\item
when binding a reference to a prvalue~(\ref{dcl.init.ref}, \ref{expr.type.conv},
\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}, \ref{expr.static.cast}, \ref{expr.const.cast}, \ref{expr.cast}),
\item
when performing member access on a class prvalue~(\ref{expr.ref}, \ref{expr.mptr.oper}),
\item
when performing an array-to-pointer conversion or subscripting on an array prvalue~(\ref{conv.array}, \ref{expr.sub}),
\item
when initializing an object of type \tcode{std::initializer_list<T>} from a \grammarterm{braced-init-list}\iref{dcl.init.list},
\item
for certain unevaluated operands~(\ref{expr.typeid}, \ref{expr.sizeof}), and

when a prvalue appears as a discarded-value expression\iref{expr.prop}.

\begin{codeblock}
class X {

  X(const X&);
  X& operator=(const X&);
  ~X();

class Y {
public:

Y g(Y);

void h() {

\tcode{X(2)} is constructed in the space used to hold \tcode{f()}'s argument and
\tcode{Y(3)} is constructed in the space used to hold \tcode{g()}'s argument.
Likewise,
\tcode{f()}'s result is constructed directly in \tcode{b} and
\tcode{g()}'s result is constructed directly in \tcode{c}.
On the other hand, the expression
\tcode{a = f(a)}
requires a temporary for
the result of \tcode{f(a)},
which is materialized so that the reference parameter
of \tcode{A::operator=(const A\&)} can bind to it.
\end{example}

\pnum
When an object of class type \tcode{X}
is passed to or returned from a function,
if each copy constructor, move constructor, and destructor of \tcode{X}
is either trivial or deleted,
and \tcode{X}

implementations are permitted
to create a temporary object
to hold the function parameter or result object.
The temporary object is constructed
from the function argument or return value, respectively,
and the function's parameter or return object
is initialized as if by
using the non-deleted trivial constructor to copy the temporary
(even if that constructor is inaccessible
or would not be selected by overload resolution
to perform a copy or move of the object).

When an implementation introduces a temporary object of a class that has a

it shall ensure that a constructor is called for the temporary object.
Similarly, the destructor shall be called for a temporary with a non-trivial
destructor\iref{class.dtor}.
Temporary objects are destroyed as the last step
in evaluating
the full-expression\iref{intro.execution}

they were created.
This is true even if that evaluation ends in throwing an exception.

\indextext{initializer!temporary and declarator}%

There are three contexts in which temporaries are destroyed at a different
point than the end of the full-expression.
The first context is when a default constructor is called to initialize
an element of an array with no corresponding initializer\iref{dcl.init}.
The second context is when a copy constructor is called to copy an element of
an array while the entire array is copied~(\ref{expr.prim.lambda.capture}, \ref{class.copy.ctor}).
In either case, if the constructor has one or more default arguments,
the destruction of every temporary created in a default argument is
sequenced before the construction of the next array element, if any.

\pnum
The third context is when a reference is bound to a
temporary object.\footnote{The same rules apply to initialization of an
  \tcode{initializer_list} object\iref{dcl.init.list} with its
  underlying temporary array.}
The temporary object to which the reference is bound or the temporary object
that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound
persists for the lifetime of the reference if the glvalue
to which the reference is bound
was obtained through one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  a temporary materialization conversion\iref{conv.rval},
\item
  \tcode{(} \grammarterm{expression} \tcode{)},
  where \grammarterm{expression} is one of these expressions,
\item
  subscripting\iref{expr.sub} of an array operand,
  where that operand is one of these expressions,
\item
  a class member access\iref{expr.ref} using the \tcode{.} operator
  where the left operand is one of these expressions and
  the right operand designates a non-static data member of non-reference type,
\item
  a pointer-to-member operation\iref{expr.mptr.oper} using the \tcode{.*} operator
  where the left operand is one of these expressions and
  the right operand is a pointer to data member of non-reference type,
\item
  a
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \tcode{const_cast}\iref{expr.const.cast},
  \item \tcode{static_cast}\iref{expr.static.cast},
  \item \tcode{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast}, or
  \item \tcode{reinterpret_cast}\iref{expr.reinterpret.cast}
  \end{itemize}
  converting, without a user-defined conversion,
  a glvalue operand that is one of these expressions
  to a glvalue that refers
  to the object designated by the operand, or
  to its complete object or a subobject thereof,
\item
  a conditional expression\iref{expr.cond} that is a glvalue
  where the second or third operand is one of these expressions, or
\item
  a comma expression\iref{expr.comma} that is a glvalue
  where the right operand is one of these expressions.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T> using id = T;

int i = 1;
int&& a = id<int[3]>{1, 2, 3}[i];          // temporary array has same lifetime as \tcode{a}
const int& b = static_cast<const int&>(0); // temporary \tcode{int} has same lifetime as \tcode{b}
int&& c = cond ? id<int[3]>{1, 2, 3}[i] : static_cast<int&&>(0);
                                           // exactly one of the two temporaries is lifetime-extended
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
An explicit type conversion~(\ref{expr.type.conv}, \ref{expr.cast})
is interpreted as
a sequence of elementary casts,
covered above.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
const int& x = (const int&)1;  // temporary for value 1 has same lifetime as x
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{note}
\begin{note}
If a temporary object has a reference member initialized by another temporary object,
lifetime extension applies recursively to such a member's initializer.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  const int& m;
};
const S& s = S{1};             // both \tcode{S} and \tcode{int} temporaries have lifetime of \tcode{s}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{note}

The exceptions to this lifetime rule are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A temporary object bound to a reference parameter in a function call\iref{expr.call}
persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the call.

\item The lifetime of a temporary bound to the returned value in a function \tcode{return} statement\iref{stmt.return} is not extended; the temporary is destroyed at the end of the full-expression in the \tcode{return} statement.

\item A temporary bound to a reference in a \grammarterm{new-initializer}\iref{expr.new} persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the \grammarterm{new-initializer}.
\begin{note} This may introduce a dangling reference. \end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S { int mi; const std::pair<int,int>& mp; };
S a { 1, {2,3} };
S* p = new S{ 1, {2,3} };      // creates dangling reference
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The destruction of a temporary whose lifetime is not extended by being
bound to a reference is sequenced before the destruction of every
temporary which is constructed earlier in the same full-expression.
If the lifetime of two or more temporaries to which references are bound ends
at the same point,
these temporaries are destroyed at that point in the reverse order of the
completion of their construction.
In addition, the destruction of temporaries bound to references shall
take into account the ordering of destruction of objects with static, thread, or
automatic storage duration~(\ref{basic.stc.static}, \ref{basic.stc.thread}, \ref{basic.stc.auto});
that is, if
\tcode{obj1}
is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created before the temporary is created
the temporary shall be destroyed before
\tcode{obj1}
is destroyed;
if
\tcode{obj2}
is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created after the temporary is created
the temporary shall be destroyed after
\tcode{obj2}
is destroyed.

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  S();
  S(int);
  friend S operator+(const S&, const S&);
  ~S();
};
S obj1;
const S& cr = S(16)+S(23);
S obj2;
\end{codeblock}

The expression
\tcode{S(16) + S(23)}
creates three temporaries:
a first temporary
\tcode{T1}
to hold the result of the expression
\tcode{S(16)},
a second temporary
\tcode{T2}
to hold the result of the expression
\tcode{S(23)},
and a third temporary
\tcode{T3}
to hold the result of the addition of these two expressions.
The temporary
\tcode{T3}
is then bound to the reference
\tcode{cr}.
It is unspecified whether
\tcode{T1}
or
\tcode{T2}
is created first.
On an implementation where
\tcode{T1}
is created before
\tcode{T2},
\tcode{T2}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{T1}.
The temporaries
\tcode{T1}
and
\tcode{T2}
are bound to the reference parameters of
\tcode{operator+};
these temporaries are destroyed at the end of the full-expression
containing the call to
\tcode{operator+}.
The temporary
\tcode{T3}
bound to the reference
\tcode{cr}
is destroyed at the end of
\tcode{cr}'s
lifetime, that is, at the end of the program.
In addition, the order in which
\tcode{T3}
is destroyed takes into account the destruction order of other objects with
static storage duration.
That is, because
\tcode{obj1}
is constructed before
\tcode{T3},
and
\tcode{T3}
is constructed before
\tcode{obj2},
\tcode{obj2}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{T3},
and
\tcode{T3}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{obj1}.

A pointer to objects of type \tcode{T} is referred to as a ``pointer to

referred to as ``pointer to \tcode{int}'' and a pointer to an object of
class \tcode{X} is called a ``pointer to \tcode{X}''. \end{example}
Except for pointers to static members, text referring to ``pointers''

a \defn{pointer past the end of} an object\iref{expr.add}, or

the \defnx{null pointer value}{value!null pointer}\iref{conv.ptr} for that type, or
\item
\indextext{invalid pointer value|see{value, invalid pointer}}
an \defnx{invalid pointer value}{value!invalid pointer}.
\end{itemize}
A value of a
pointer type
that is a pointer to or past the end of an object
\defn{represents the address} of
the first byte in memory\iref{intro.memory} occupied by the object%
\footnote{For an object that is not within its lifetime,
this is the first byte in memory that it will occupy or used to occupy.}
or the first byte in memory
after the end of the storage occupied by the object,
respectively.
\begin{note}
A pointer past the end of an object\iref{expr.add}
is not considered to point to an unrelated object
of the object's type
that might be located at that address.
A pointer value becomes invalid
when the storage it denotes
reaches the end of its storage duration;
see \ref{basic.stc}.
\end{note}
For purposes of pointer arithmetic\iref{expr.add}
and comparison~(\ref{expr.rel}, \ref{expr.eq}),
a pointer past the end of the last element of
an array \tcode{x} of $n$ elements
is considered to be equivalent to
a pointer to a hypothetical element \tcode{x[$n$]}.
The value representation of
pointer types is \impldef{value representation of pointer types}. Pointers to
layout-compatible types shall
have the same value representation and alignment
requirements\iref{basic.align}.
\begin{note} Pointers to over-aligned types\iref{basic.align} have no special

There is a partial ordering on cv-qualifiers, so that a type can be

\tref{relations.on.const.and.volatile} shows the relations that

In this document, the notation \cv{} (or
\cvqual{cv1}, \cvqual{cv2}, etc.), used in the description of types,
represents an arbitrary set of cv-qualifiers, i.e., one of
\{\tcode{const}\}, \{\tcode{volatile}\}, \{\tcode{const},
\tcode{volatile}\}, or the empty set.
For a type \cv{}~\tcode{T}, the \defnx{top-level cv-qualifiers}{cv-qualifier!top-level}
of that type are those denoted by \cv.
\begin{example}
The type corresponding to the \grammarterm{type-id}
\tcode{const int\&}
has no top-level cv-qualifiers.
The type corresponding to the \grammarterm{type-id}
\tcode{volatile int * const}
has the top-level cv-qualifier \tcode{const}.
For a class type \tcode{C},
the type corresponding to the \grammarterm{type-id}
\tcode{void (C::* volatile)(int) const}
has the top-level cv-qualifier \tcode{volatile}.
\end{example}

\pnum
Cv-qualifiers applied to an array
type attach to the underlying element type, so the notation
``\cv{}~\tcode{T}'', where \tcode{T} is an array type, refers to
an array whose elements are so-qualified. An array type whose elements
are cv-qualified is also considered to have the same cv-qualifications
as its elements.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
typedef char CA[5];
typedef const char CC;
CC arr1[5] = { 0 };
const CA arr2 = { 0 };
\end{codeblock}
The type of both \tcode{arr1} and \tcode{arr2} is ``array of 5
\tcode{const char}'', and the array type is considered to be
const-qualified.

\item The rank of any extended signed integer type relative to another
extended signed integer type with the same size is \impldef{rank of extended signed

If a language construct is defined to produce an implicit call of a function,
a use of the language construct is considered to be an expression
for the purposes of this definition.
Conversions applied to the result of an expression in order to satisfy the requirements
of the language construct in which the expression appears
are also considered to be part of the full-expression.
For an initializer, performing the initialization of the entity
(including evaluating default member initializers of an aggregate)
is also considered part of the full-expression.

\begin{note} The evaluation of a full-expression can include the
evaluation of subexpressions that are not lexically part of the

\defnx{Sequenced before}{sequenced before} is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between

Several contexts in \Cpp{} cause evaluation of a function call, even
though no corresponding function call syntax appears in the translation
unit.
\begin{example}
Evaluation of a \grammarterm{new-expression} invokes one or more allocation

invocation of a conversion function\iref{class.conv.fct} can arise in
contexts in which no function call syntax appears.

subsequently executed by the thread. \begin{note} When one thread creates another,
the initial call to the top-level function of the new thread is executed by the
new thread, not by the creating thread. \end{note} Every thread in a program can
potentially access every object and function in a program.\footnote{An object
with automatic or thread storage duration\iref{basic.stc} is associated with
one specific thread, and can be accessed by a different thread only indirectly
through a pointer or reference\iref{basic.compound}.} Under a hosted
implementation, a \Cpp{} program can have more than one thread running
concurrently. The execution of each thread proceeds as defined by the remainder
of this document. The execution of the entire program consists of an execution
of all of its threads. \begin{note} Usually the execution can be viewed as an
interleaving of all its threads. However, some kinds of atomic operations, for
example, allow executions inconsistent with a simple interleaving, as described
below. \end{note} Under a freestanding implementation, it is \impldef{number of

Two expression evaluations \defn{conflict} if one of them modifies a memory

\pnum
The library defines a number of atomic operations\iref{atomics} and
operations on mutexes\iref{thread} that are specially identified as
synchronization operations. These operations play a special role in making
assignments in one thread visible to another. A synchronization operation on one
or more memory locations is either a consume operation, an acquire operation, a
release operation, or both an acquire and release operation. A synchronization
operation without an associated memory location is a fence and can be either an
acquire fence, a release fence, or both an acquire and release fence. In
addition, there are relaxed atomic operations, which are not synchronization
operations, and atomic read-modify-write operations, which have special
characteristics. \begin{note} For example, a call that acquires a mutex will
perform an acquire operation on the locations comprising the mutex.
Correspondingly, a call that releases the same mutex will perform a release
operation on those same locations. Informally, performing a release operation on
\placeholder{A} forces prior
\indextext{side effects}%
side effects on other memory locations to become visible
to other threads that later perform a consume or an acquire operation on
\placeholder{A}. ``Relaxed'' atomic operations are not synchronization operations even
though, like synchronization operations, they cannot contribute to data races.

total order for all objects. In general this will be impossible since different
threads may observe modifications to different objects in inconsistent orders.

Certain library calls \defn{synchronize with} other library calls performed by

\begin{note} Except in the specified cases, reading a later value does not
necessarily ensure visibility as described below. Such a requirement would
sometimes interfere with efficient implementation. \end{note} \begin{note} The
specifications of the synchronization operations define when one reads the value
written by another. For atomic objects, the definition is clear. All operations
on a given mutex occur in a single total order. Each mutex acquisition ``reads

concatenations of ``sequenced before'', ``synchronizes with'' and
``dependency-ordered before'' relationships, with two exceptions. The first
exception is that a concatenation is not permitted to end with
``dependency-ordered before'' followed by ``sequenced before''. The reason for
this limitation is that a consume operation participating in a
``dependency-ordered before'' relationship provides ordering only with respect
to operations to which this consume operation actually carries a dependency. The
reason that this limitation applies only to the end of such a concatenation is
that any subsequent release operation will provide the required ordering for a
prior consume operation. The second exception is that a concatenation is not
permitted to consist entirely of ``sequenced before''. The reasons for this
limitation are (1) to permit ``inter-thread happens before'' to be transitively
closed and (2) the ``happens before'' relation, defined below, provides for
relationships consisting entirely of ``sequenced before''. \end{note}

Two actions are \defn{potentially concurrent} if
\begin{itemize}
\item they are performed by different threads, or
\item they are unsequenced, at least one is performed by a signal handler, and
they are not both performed by the same signal handler invocation.
\end{itemize}
The execution of a program contains a \defn{data race} if it contains two
potentially concurrent conflicting actions, at least one of which is not atomic,
and neither happens before the other,
except for the special case for signal handlers described below.
Any such data race results in undefined
behavior. \begin{note} It can be shown that programs that correctly use mutexes
and \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} operations to prevent all data races and use no
other synchronization operations behave as if the operations executed by their
constituent threads were simply interleaved, with each
\indextext{value computation}%
value computation of an
object being taken from the last
\indextext{side effects}%
side effect on that object in that
interleaving. This is normally referred to as ``sequential consistency''.
However, this applies only to data-race-free programs, and data-race-free
programs cannot observe most program transformations that do not change
single-threaded program semantics. In fact, most single-threaded program
transformations continue to be allowed, since any program that behaves
differently as a result must perform an undefined operation. \end{note}

\pnum
Two accesses to the same object of type \tcode{volatile std::sig_atomic_t} do not
result in a data race if both occur in the same thread, even if one or more

performed by the thread invoking a signal handler can be divided into two
groups \placeholder{A} and \placeholder{B}, such that no evaluations in
\placeholder{B} happen before evaluations in \placeholder{A}, and the
evaluations of such \tcode{volatile std::sig_atomic_t} objects take values as though
all evaluations in \placeholder{A} happened before the execution of the signal
handler and the execution of the signal handler happened before all evaluations
in \placeholder{B}.

\pnum
\begin{note} Compiler transformations that introduce assignments to a potentially
shared memory location that would not be modified by the abstract machine are
generally precluded by this document, since such an assignment might overwrite
another assignment by a different thread in cases in which an abstract machine
execution would not have encountered a data race. This includes implementations
of data member assignment that overwrite adjacent members in separate memory
locations. Reordering of atomic loads in cases in which the atomics in question
may alias is also generally precluded, since this may violate the coherence
rules. \end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note} Transformations that introduce a speculative read of a potentially
shared memory location may not preserve the semantics of the \Cpp{} program as
defined in this document, since they potentially introduce a data race. However,
they are typically valid in the context of an optimizing compiler that targets a
specific machine with well-defined semantics for data races. They would be
invalid for a hypothetical machine that is not tolerant of races or provides
hardware race detection. \end{note}

    Concurrently executing threads

    For example,

    with load-locked store-conditional implementations.
    This property is sometimes termed obstruction-free.
  \end{note}
\item
  When one or more lock-free executions run concurrently,
  at least one should complete.
  \begin{note}
    It is difficult for some implementations
    to provide absolute guarantees to this effect,
    since repeated and particularly inopportune interference
    from other threads
    may prevent forward progress,
    e.g.,
    by repeatedly stealing a cache line
    for unrelated purposes
    between load-locked and store-conditional instructions.
    Implementations should ensure
    that such effects cannot indefinitely delay progress
    under expected operating conditions,

    can therefore safely be ignored by programmers.

A library I/O function that blocks until the I/O operation is complete can
be considered to continuously check whether the operation is complete. Each
such check might consist of one or more execution steps, for example using
observable behavior of the abstract machine.
\end{example}

Because of this and the preceding requirement regarding what threads of execution

forever without an execution step occurring.

this will happen in an unspecified but finite amount of time.

For a thread of execution providing \defn{parallel forward progress guarantees},
the implementation is not required to ensure that the thread will eventually make

executed a step, it provides concurrent forward progress guarantees.

\pnum
\begin{note}
This does not specify a requirement for when to start this thread of execution,
which will typically be specified by the entity that creates this thread of
execution. For example, a thread of execution that provides concurrent forward
progress guarantees and executes tasks from a set of tasks in an arbitrary order,
one after the other, satisfies the requirements of parallel forward progress for
these tasks.
\end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{forward progress guarantees!weakly parallel}%
For a thread of execution providing \defn{weakly parallel forward progress

Threads of execution providing weakly parallel forward progress guarantees cannot
be expected to make progress regardless of whether other threads make progress or
not; however, blocking with forward progress guarantee delegation, as defined below,
can be used to ensure that such threads of execution make progress eventually.
\end{note}

\pnum
Concurrent forward progress guarantees are stronger than parallel forward progress
guarantees, which in turn are stronger than weakly parallel forward progress
guarantees.

provided by at least one thread of execution in \placeholder{S} is at least as strong
as \placeholder{P}'s forward progress guarantees.
\begin{note}
It is unspecified which thread or threads of execution in \placeholder{S} are chosen
and for which number of execution steps. The strengthening is not permanent and
not necessarily in place for the rest of the lifetime of the affected thread of
execution. As long as \placeholder{P} is blocked, the implementation has to eventually
select and potentially strengthen a thread of execution in \placeholder{S}.
\end{note}
Once a thread of execution in \placeholder{S} terminates, it is removed from \placeholder{S}.
Once \placeholder{S} is empty, \placeholder{P} is unblocked.

\pnum
\begin{note}
A thread of execution \placeholder{B} thus can temporarily provide an effectively
stronger forward progress guarantee for a certain amount of time, due to a
second thread of execution \placeholder{A} being blocked on it with forward
progress guarantee delegation. In turn, if \placeholder{B} then blocks with
forward progress guarantee delegation on \placeholder{C}, this may also temporarily
provide a stronger forward progress guarantee to \placeholder{C}.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
If all threads of execution in \placeholder{S} finish executing (e.g., they terminate
and do not use blocking synchronization incorrectly), then \placeholder{P}'s execution
of the operation that blocks with forward progress guarantee delegation will not
result in \placeholder{P}'s progress guarantee being effectively weakened.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
This does not remove any constraints regarding blocking synchronization for
threads of execution providing parallel or weakly parallel forward progress
guarantees because the implementation is not required to strengthen a particular
thread of execution whose too-weak progress guarantee is preventing overall progress.

object with static storage duration initialized during the construction
of the subobjects is destroyed.
If the destruction of an object with static or thread storage duration
exits via an exception,
the function \tcode{std::terminate} is called\iref{except.terminate}.

\pnum
If a function contains a block-scope object of static or thread storage duration that has been
destroyed and the function is called during the destruction of an object with static or
thread storage duration, the program has undefined behavior if the flow of control
passes through the definition of the previously destroyed block-scope object. Likewise, the
behavior is undefined if the block-scope object is used indirectly (i.e., through a
pointer) after its destruction.

\pnum
\indextext{\idxcode{atexit}}%
\indexlibrary{\idxcode{atexit}}%
If the completion of the initialization of an object with static storage
duration strongly happens before a call to \tcode{std::atexit}~(see
\tcode{<cstdlib>}, \ref{support.start.term}), the call to the function passed to
\tcode{std::atexit} is sequenced before the call to the destructor for the object. If a
call to \tcode{std::atexit} strongly happens before the completion of the initialization of
an object with static storage duration, the call to the destructor for the
object is sequenced before the call to the function passed to \tcode{std::atexit}. If a
call to \tcode{std::atexit} strongly happens before another call to \tcode{std::atexit}, the
call to the function passed to the second \tcode{std::atexit} call is sequenced before
the call to the function passed to the first \tcode{std::atexit} call.

\pnum
If there is a use of a standard library object or function not permitted within signal
handlers\iref{support.runtime} that does not happen before\iref{intro.multithread}
completion of destruction of objects with static storage duration and execution of
\tcode{std::atexit} registered functions\iref{support.start.term}, the program has
undefined behavior. \begin{note} If there is a use of an object with static storage
duration that does not happen before the object's destruction, the program has undefined
behavior. Terminating every thread before a call to \tcode{std::exit} or the exit from
\tcode{main} is sufficient, but not necessary, to satisfy these requirements. These
requirements permit thread managers as static-storage-duration objects. \end{note}

\pnum
\indextext{\idxcode{abort}}%

\indextext{termination!program}%
Calling the function \tcode{std::abort()} declared in

\tcode{<cstdlib>} terminates the program without executing any destructors
and without calling
the functions passed to \tcode{std::atexit()} or \tcode{std::at_quick_exit()}.%
