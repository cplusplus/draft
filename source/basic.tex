\pnum
\begin{note}
This Clause presents the basic concepts of the \Cpp{} language.
It explains the difference between an object and a
name and how they relate to the value categories for expressions.
It introduces the concepts of a
declaration and a definition and presents \Cpp{}'s
notion of type, scope, linkage, and
storage duration. The mechanisms for starting and
terminating a program are discussed. Finally, this Clause presents the
fundamental types of the language and lists the ways of constructing
compound types from these.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
This Clause does not cover concepts that affect only a single
part of the language. Such concepts are discussed in the relevant
Clauses.

An \defn{entity} is a value, object, reference,
structured binding,
function, enumerator, type,
class member, bit-field, template, template specialization, namespace, or
pack.

\pnum
A \defn{name} is an \grammarterm{identifier}\iref{lex.name},
\grammarterm{operator-function-id}\iref{over.oper},
\grammarterm{literal-operator-id}\iref{over.literal}, or
\grammarterm{conversion-function-id}\iref{class.conv.fct}.

\pnum
Every name is introduced by a \defn{declaration}, which is a
\begin{itemize}
\item
\grammarterm{declaration},
\grammarterm{block-declaration}, or
\grammarterm{member-declaration} (\ref{dcl.pre}, \ref{class.mem}),
\item
\grammarterm{init-declarator}\iref{dcl.decl},
\item
\grammarterm{identifier}
in a structured binding declaration\iref{dcl.struct.bind},
\item
\grammarterm{init-capture}\iref{expr.prim.lambda.capture},
\item
\grammarterm{condition} with a \grammarterm{declarator}\iref{stmt.pre},
\item
\grammarterm{member-declarator}\iref{class.mem},
\item
\grammarterm{using-declarator}\iref{namespace.udecl},
\item
\grammarterm{parameter-declaration}\iref{dcl.fct},
\item
\grammarterm{type-parameter}\iref{temp.param},
\item
\grammarterm{elaborated-type-specifier}
that introduces a name\iref{dcl.type.elab},
\item
\grammarterm{class-specifier}\iref{class.pre},
\item
\grammarterm{enum-specifier} or
\grammarterm{enumerator-definition}\iref{dcl.enum},
\item
\grammarterm{exception-declaration}\iref{except.pre}, or
\item
implicit declaration of an injected-class-name\iref{class.pre}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
The interpretation of a \grammarterm{for-range-declaration} produces
one or more of the above\iref{stmt.ranged}.
\end{note}
An entity $E$ is denoted by the name (if any)
that is introduced by a declaration of $E$ or
by a \grammarterm{typedef-name} introduced by a declaration specifying $E$.

\pnum
A \defn{variable} is introduced by the
declaration of
a reference other than a non-static data member or of
an object. The variable's name, if any, denotes the reference or object.

\pnum
A \defnadj{local}{entity} is a variable with
automatic storage duration\iref{basic.stc.auto},
a structured binding\iref{dcl.struct.bind}
whose corresponding variable is such an entity,
or the \tcode{*\keyword{this}} object\iref{expr.prim.this}.

\pnum
Some names denote types or templates. In general,
whenever a name is encountered it is necessary to determine whether that name denotes
one of these entities before continuing to parse the program that contains it. The
process that determines this is called
\defnx{name lookup}{lookup!name}\iref{basic.lookup}.

\pnum
Two names are \defnx{the same}{name!same} if
\begin{itemize}
\item they are \grammarterm{identifier}{s} composed of the same character sequence, or
\item they are \grammarterm{operator-function-id}{s} formed with
the same operator, or
\item they are \grammarterm{conversion-function-id}{s} formed
with equivalent\iref{temp.over.link} types, or
\item they are \grammarterm{literal-operator-id}{s}\iref{over.literal} formed with
the same literal suffix identifier.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\indextext{translation unit!name and}%
\indextext{linkage}%
A name used in more than one translation unit can potentially
refer to the same entity in these translation units depending on the
linkage\iref{basic.link} of the name specified in each
translation unit.

\rSec1[basic.def]{Declarations and definitions}

\pnum
\indextext{declaration!definition versus}%
\indextext{declaration}%
\indextext{declaration!name}%
A declaration\iref{dcl.dcl} may (re)introduce
one or more names and/or entities into a translation
unit.
If so, the
declaration specifies the interpretation and semantic properties of these names.
A declaration of an entity or \grammarterm{typedef-name} $X$ is
a redeclaration of $X$
if another declaration of $X$ is reachable from it\iref{module.reach}.
A declaration may also have effects including:
\begin{itemize}
\item a static assertion\iref{dcl.pre},
\item controlling template instantiation\iref{temp.explicit},
\item guiding template argument deduction for constructors\iref{temp.deduct.guide},
\item use of attributes\iref{dcl.attr}, and
\item nothing (in the case of an \grammarterm{empty-declaration}).
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\indextext{declaration!function}%
\indextext{definition}%
Each entity declared by a \grammarterm{declaration} is
also \defnx{defined}{define} by that declaration unless:
\begin{itemize}
\item
it declares a function
without specifying the function's body\iref{dcl.fct.def},
\item
it contains
the
\indextext{declaration!\idxcode{extern}}%
\keyword{extern} specifier\iref{dcl.stc} or a
\grammarterm{linkage-specification}

Appearing inside the brace-enclosed
\grammarterm{declaration-seq} in a \grammarterm{linkage-specification} does
not affect whether a declaration is a definition.

\grammarterm{function-body},
\item
\indextext{declaration!static member@\tcode{static} member}%
it declares a non-inline static data member in a class
definition~(\ref{class.mem}, \ref{class.static}),
\item
it declares a static data member outside a class definition
and the variable was defined within the class with the \keyword{constexpr}
specifier (this usage is deprecated; see \ref{depr.static.constexpr}),

\grammarterm{parameter-declaration}\iref{dcl.fct} in a function
\indextext{declarator}%
declarator that is not the \grammarterm{declarator} of a

\item
it is an
\grammarterm{empty-declaration}\iref{dcl.pre},
\item it is
a \grammarterm{using-directive}\iref{namespace.udir},
\item it is
a \grammarterm{using-enum-declaration}\iref{enum.udecl},
\item it is
a \grammarterm{template-declaration}\iref{temp.pre}
whose \grammarterm{template-head} is not followed by
either a \grammarterm{concept-definition} or a \grammarterm{declaration}
that defines a function, a class, a variable, or a static data member.
\item it is
an explicit instantiation declaration\iref{temp.explicit}, or
\item it is
an explicit specialization\iref{temp.expl.spec} whose
\grammarterm{declaration} is not a definition.
\end{itemize}
A declaration is said to be a \defn{definition} of each entity that it defines.
\begin{example}
All but one of the following are definitions:
\begin{codeblock}
int a;                          // defines \tcode{a}
extern const int c = 1;         // defines \tcode{c}
int f(int x) { return x+a; }    // defines \tcode{f} and defines \tcode{x}
struct S { int a; int b; };     // defines \tcode{S}, \tcode{S::a}, and \tcode{S::b}
struct X {                      // defines \tcode{X}
  int x;                        // defines non-static data member \tcode{x}
  static int y;                 // declares static data member \tcode{y}
  X(): x(0) { }                 // defines a constructor of \tcode{X}
};
int X::y = 1;                   // defines \tcode{X::y}
enum { up, down };              // defines \tcode{up} and \tcode{down}
namespace N { int d; }          // defines \tcode{N} and \tcode{N::d}
namespace N1 = N;               // defines \tcode{N1}
X anX;                          // defines \tcode{anX}

\end{codeblock}
whereas these are just declarations:
\begin{codeblock}
extern int a;                   // declares \tcode{a}
extern const int c;             // declares \tcode{c}
int f(int);                     // declares \tcode{f}
struct S;                       // declares \tcode{S}
typedef int Int;                // declares \tcode{Int}
extern X anotherX;              // declares \tcode{anotherX}
using N::d;                     // declares \tcode{d}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
\indextext{implementation-generated}%
In some circumstances, \Cpp{} implementations implicitly define the
default constructor\iref{class.default.ctor},
copy constructor, move constructor\iref{class.copy.ctor},
copy assignment operator, move assignment operator\iref{class.copy.assign},
or destructor\iref{class.dtor} member functions.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
Given
\begin{codeblock}
#include <string>

struct C {
  std::string s;                // \tcode{std::string} is the standard library class\iref{string.classes}
};

int main() {
  C a;
  C b = a;
  b = a;
}
\end{codeblock}
the implementation will implicitly define functions to make the
definition of \tcode{C} equivalent to
\begin{codeblock}
struct C {
  std::string s;
  C() : s() { }
  C(const C& x): s(x.s) { }
  C(C&& x): s(static_cast<std::string&&>(x.s)) { }
      @\rlap{\normalfont\itshape //}@    : s(std::move(x.s)) { }
  C& operator=(const C& x) { s = x.s; return *this; }
  C& operator=(C&& x) { s = static_cast<std::string&&>(x.s); return *this; }
      @\rlap{\normalfont\itshape //}@                { s = std::move(x.s); return *this; }
  ~C() { }

\indextext{type!incomplete}%
In the definition of an object,
the type of that object shall not be

No translation unit shall contain more than one definition of any

default argument for a parameter (for a function in a given scope), or
default template argument.

\pnum
\indextext{expression!potentially evaluated}%
An expression or conversion is \defn{potentially evaluated} unless it is
an unevaluated operand\iref{expr.prop},
a subexpression thereof, or
a conversion in an initialization or conversion sequence in such a context.
The set of \defn{potential results} of an expression $E$ is
defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $E$ is an
\grammarterm{id-expression}\iref{expr.prim.id}, the set
contains only $E$.
\item If $E$ is a subscripting operation\iref{expr.sub} with
an array operand, the set contains the potential results of that operand.
\item If $E$ is a class member access
expression\iref{expr.ref} of the form
$E_1$ \tcode{.} \opt{\keyword{template}} $E_2$
naming a non-static data member,
the set contains the potential results of $E_1$.
\item If $E$ is a class member access expression
naming a static data member,
the set contains the \grammarterm{id-expression} designating the data member.
\item If $E$ is a pointer-to-member
expression\iref{expr.mptr.oper} of the form
$E_1$ \tcode{.*} $E_2$,
the set contains the potential results of $E_1$.
\item If $E$ has the form \tcode{($E_1$)}, the set contains the
potential results of $E_1$.
\item If $E$ is a glvalue conditional
expression\iref{expr.cond}, the set is the union of the sets of
potential results of the second and third operands.
\item If $E$ is a comma expression\iref{expr.comma}, the set
contains the potential results of the right operand.
\item Otherwise, the set is empty.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
This set is a (possibly-empty) set of \grammarterm{id-expression}{s},
each of which is either $E$ or a subexpression of $E$.
\begin{example}
In the following example, the set of potential results of the initializer
of \tcode{n} contains the first \tcode{S::x} subexpression, but not the second
\tcode{S::x} subexpression.
\begin{codeblock}
struct S { static const int x = 0; };
const int &f(const int &r);
int n = b ? (1, S::x)           // \tcode{S::x} is not odr-used here
          : f(S::x);            // \tcode{S::x} is odr-used here, so a definition is required
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{note}

\pnum
A function is \defnx{named by}{function!named by expression or conversion}
an expression or conversion as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  A function is named by an expression or conversion
  if it is the selected member
  of an overload set~(\ref{basic.lookup}, \ref{over.match}, \ref{over.over})
  in an overload resolution performed
  as part of forming that expression or conversion,
  unless it is a pure virtual function and either
  the expression is not an \grammarterm{id-expression} naming the function with
  an explicitly qualified name or
  the expression forms a pointer to member\iref{expr.unary.op}.
  \begin{note}
This covers
  taking the address of functions~(\ref{conv.func}, \ref{expr.unary.op}),
  calls to named functions\iref{expr.call},
  operator overloading\iref{over},
  user-defined conversions\iref{class.conv.fct},
  allocation functions for \grammarterm{new-expression}{s}\iref{expr.new}, as well as
  non-default initialization\iref{dcl.init}.
  A constructor selected to copy or move an object of class type
  is considered to be named by an expression or conversion
  even if the call is actually elided by the implementation\iref{class.copy.elision}.
\end{note}
\item
  A deallocation function for a class
  is named by a \grammarterm{new-expression}
  if it is the single matching deallocation function
  for the allocation function selected by overload resolution,
  as specified in~\ref{expr.new}.
\item
  A deallocation function for a class
  is named by a \grammarterm{delete-expression}
  if it is the selected usual deallocation function
  as specified in~\ref{expr.delete} and~\ref{class.free}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
A variable is named by an expression
if the expression is an \grammarterm{id-expression} that denotes it.
A variable \tcode{x} whose name appears as a
potentially-evaluated expression $E$
is \defnx{odr-used}{odr-use} by $E$ unless
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \tcode{x} is a reference that is
  usable in constant expressions\iref{expr.const}, or
\item
  \tcode{x} is a variable of non-reference type that is
  usable in constant expressions and has no mutable subobjects, and
  $E$ is an element of the set of potential results of an expression
  of non-volatile-qualified non-class type
  to which the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion\iref{conv.lval} is applied, or
\item
  \tcode{x} is a variable of non-reference type, and
  $E$ is an element of the set of potential results
  of a discarded-value expression\iref{expr.prop}
  to which the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is not applied.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
A structured binding is odr-used if it appears as a potentially-evaluated expression.

\pnum
\tcode{*\keyword{this}} is odr-used if \keyword{this} appears as a potentially-evaluated expression
(including as the result of the implicit transformation in the body of a non-static
member function~(\ref{class.mfct.non-static})).

\pnum
A virtual member
function is odr-used if it is not pure.
A function is odr-used if it is named by
a potentially-evaluated expression or conversion.
A non-placement allocation or deallocation
function for a class is odr-used by the definition of a constructor of that
class. A non-placement deallocation function for a class is odr-used by the
definition of the destructor of that class, or by being selected by the
lookup at the point of definition of a virtual
destructor\iref{class.dtor}.
\begin{footnote}
An implementation is not required
to call allocation and
deallocation functions from constructors or destructors; however, this
is a permissible implementation technique.
\end{footnote}

\pnum
An assignment operator function in a class is odr-used by an
implicitly-defined
copy-assignment or move-assignment function for another class as specified
in~\ref{class.copy.assign}.
A constructor for a class is odr-used as specified
in~\ref{dcl.init}. A destructor for a class is odr-used if it is potentially
invoked\iref{class.dtor}.

\pnum
A local entity\iref{basic.pre}
is \defn{odr-usable} in a scope\iref{basic.scope.scope} if:
\begin{itemize}
\item either the local entity is not \tcode{*\keyword{this}}, or
an enclosing class or non-lambda function parameter scope exists and,
if the innermost such scope is a function parameter scope,
it corresponds to a non-static member function, and
\item
for each intervening scope\iref{basic.scope.scope}
between the point at which the entity is introduced and the scope
(where \tcode{*\keyword{this}} is considered to be introduced
within the innermost enclosing class or non-lambda function definition scope),
either:
\begin{itemize}
\item the intervening scope is a block scope, or
\item the intervening scope is the function parameter scope of a \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
that has a \grammarterm{simple-capture}
naming the entity or has a \grammarterm{capture-default}, and
the block scope of the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
is also an intervening scope.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If a local entity is odr-used
in a scope in which it is not odr-usable,
the program is ill-formed.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void f(int n) {
  [] { n = 1; };                // error: \tcode{n} is not odr-usable due to intervening lambda-expression
  struct A {
    void f() { n = 2; }         // error: \tcode{n} is not odr-usable due to intervening function definition scope
  };
  void g(int = n);              // error: \tcode{n} is not odr-usable due to intervening function parameter scope
  [=](int k = n) {};            // error: \tcode{n} is not odr-usable due to being
                                // outside the block scope of the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}
  [&] { [n]{ return n; }; };    // OK
}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\pnum
Every program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline
function or variable that is odr-used in that program
outside of a discarded statement\iref{stmt.if}; no diagnostic required.
The definition can appear explicitly in the program, it can be found in
the standard or a user-defined library, or (when appropriate) it is
implicitly defined (see~\ref{class.default.ctor}, \ref{class.copy.ctor},
\ref{class.dtor}, and \ref{class.copy.assign}).
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
auto f() {
  struct A {};
  return A{};
}
decltype(f()) g();
auto x = g();
\end{codeblock}
A program containing this translation unit is ill-formed
because \tcode{g} is odr-used but not defined,
and cannot be defined in any other translation unit
because the local class \tcode{A} cannot be named outside this
translation unit.
\end{example}

\pnum
A \defn{definition domain} is
a \grammarterm{private-module-fragment} or
the portion of a translation unit
excluding its \grammarterm{private-module-fragment} (if any).
A definition of an inline function or variable shall be reachable
from the end of every definition domain
in which it is odr-used outside of a discarded statement.

\pnum
\indextext{type!incomplete}%
A definition of a class shall be reachable in every context in which
the class is used in a way that requires the class type to be complete.
\begin{example}
The following complete translation unit is well-formed,
even though it never defines \tcode{X}:
\begin{codeblock}
struct X;                       // declare \tcode{X} as a struct type
struct X* x1;                   // use \tcode{X} in pointer formation
X* x2;                          // use \tcode{X} in pointer formation
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
The rules for declarations and expressions
describe in which contexts complete class types are required. A class
type \tcode{T} must be complete if:
\begin{itemize}
\item an object of type \tcode{T} is defined\iref{basic.def}, or
\item a non-static class data member of type \tcode{T} is
declared\iref{class.mem}, or
\item \tcode{T} is used as the allocated type or array element type in a
\grammarterm{new-expression}\iref{expr.new}, or
\item an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to
a glvalue referring
to an object of type \tcode{T}\iref{conv.lval}, or
\item an expression is converted (either implicitly or explicitly) to
type \tcode{T} (\ref{conv}, \ref{expr.type.conv},
\ref{expr.dynamic.cast}, \ref{expr.static.cast}, \ref{expr.cast}), or
\item an expression that is not a null pointer constant, and has type
other than \cv{}~\tcode{\keyword{void}*}, is converted to the type pointer to \tcode{T}
or reference to \tcode{T} using a standard conversion\iref{conv},
a \keyword{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast} or
a \keyword{static_cast}\iref{expr.static.cast}, or
\item a class member access operator is applied to an expression of type
\tcode{T}\iref{expr.ref}, or
\item the \keyword{typeid} operator\iref{expr.typeid} or the
\keyword{sizeof} operator\iref{expr.sizeof} is applied to an operand of
type \tcode{T}, or
\item a function with a return type or argument type of type \tcode{T}
is defined\iref{basic.def} or called\iref{expr.call}, or
\item a class with a base class of type \tcode{T} is
defined\iref{class.derived}, or
\item an lvalue of type \tcode{T} is assigned to\iref{expr.ass}, or
\item the type \tcode{T} is the subject of an

the corresponding \grammarterm{lambda-expression}.
\item In each such definition, corresponding names, looked up
according to~\ref{basic.lookup}, shall refer to the same entity, after
overload resolution\iref{over.match} and after matching of partial
template specialization\iref{temp.over}, except that a name can refer to
\begin{itemize}
\item
a non-volatile const object with internal or no linkage if the object
\begin{itemize}
\item has the same literal type in all definitions of \tcode{D},
\item is initialized with a constant expression\iref{expr.const},
\item is not odr-used in any definition of \tcode{D}, and
\item has the same value in all definitions of \tcode{D},
\end{itemize}
or
\item
a reference with internal or no linkage
initialized with a constant expression such that
the reference refers to the same entity in all definitions of \tcode{D}.
\end{itemize}

\item In each such definition, except within
the default arguments and default template arguments of \tcode{D},
corresponding \grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s} shall have
the same closure type (see below).

\item In each such definition, corresponding entities shall have the
same language linkage.

\item In each such definition, the overloaded operators referred
to, the implicit calls to conversion functions, constructors, operator
new functions and operator delete functions, shall refer to the same
function.

\item In each such definition,
a default argument used by an (implicit or explicit) function call or
a default template argument used by an (implicit or explicit)
\grammarterm{template-id} or \grammarterm{simple-template-id}
is treated as if its token sequence
were present in the definition of \tcode{D};
that is, the default argument or default template argument
is subject to the requirements described in this paragraph (recursively).

\item If \tcode{D} is a class with an implicitly-declared
constructor (\ref{class.default.ctor}, \ref{class.copy.ctor}),
it is as if the constructor was
implicitly defined in every translation unit where it is odr-used, and the
implicit definition in every translation unit shall call the same
constructor for a subobject of \tcode{D}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
// translation unit 1:
struct X {
  X(int, int);
  X(int, int, int);
};
X::X(int, int = 0) { }
class D {
  X x = 0;
};
D d1;                           // \tcode{X(int, int)} called by \tcode{D()}

// translation unit 2:
struct X {
  X(int, int);
  X(int, int, int);
};
X::X(int, int = 0, int = 0) { }
class D {
  X x = 0;
};
D d2;                           // \tcode{X(int, int, int)} called by \tcode{D()};
                                // \tcode{D()}'s implicit definition violates the ODR
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}

\item If \tcode{D} is a class with
a defaulted three-way comparison operator function\iref{class.spaceship},
it is as if the operator was
implicitly defined in every translation unit where it is odr-used, and the
implicit definition in every translation unit shall call the same
comparison operators for each subobject of \tcode{D}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
If \tcode{D} is a template and is defined in more than one
translation unit, then the preceding requirements
shall apply both to names from the template's enclosing scope used in the
template definition, and also to dependent names at
the point of instantiation\iref{temp.dep}.
These requirements also apply to corresponding entities
defined within each definition of \tcode{D}
(including the closure types of \grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s},
but excluding entities defined within default arguments or
default template arguments of either \tcode{D} or
an entity not defined within \tcode{D}).
For each such entity and for \tcode{D} itself,
the behavior is as if there is a single entity with a single definition,
including in the application of these requirements to other entities.
\begin{note}
The entity is still declared in multiple translation units, and \ref{basic.link}
still applies to these declarations. In particular,
\grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s}\iref{expr.prim.lambda}
appearing in the type of \tcode{D} can result
in the different declarations having distinct types, and
\grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s} appearing in a default argument of \tcode{D}
might still denote different types in different translation units.
\end{note}

\pnum
If these definitions do not satisfy these requirements,
then the program is ill-formed;
a diagnostic is required only if
the entity is attached to a named module and
a prior definition is reachable at the point where a later definition occurs.

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
inline void f(bool cond, void (*p)()) {
  if (cond) f(false, []{});
}
inline void g(bool cond, void (*p)() = []{}) {
  if (cond) g(false);
}
struct X {
  void h(bool cond, void (*p)() = []{}) {
    if (cond) h(false);
  }
};
\end{codeblock}

If the definition of \tcode{f} appears in multiple translation units,
the behavior of the program is as if
there is only one definition of \tcode{f}.
If the definition of \tcode{g} appears in multiple translation units,
the program is ill-formed (no diagnostic required) because
each such definition uses a default argument that
refers to a distinct \grammarterm{lambda-expression} closure type.
The definition of \tcode{X} can appear
in multiple translation units of a valid program;
the \grammarterm{lambda-expression}{s} defined within
the default argument of \tcode{X::h} within the definition of \tcode{X}
denote the same closure type in each translation unit.
\end{example}

\pnum
If, at any point in the program,
there is more than one
reachable unnamed enumeration definition in the same scope
that have the same first enumerator name and
do not have typedef names for linkage purposes\iref{dcl.enum},
those unnamed enumeration types shall be the same; no diagnostic required.

A \defn{search} in a scope $X$ for a name $N$ from a program point $P$
is a single search in $X$ for $N$ from $P$
unless $X$ is the scope of a class or class template $T$, in which case the
following steps define the result of the search.
\begin{note}
The result differs only
if $N$ is a \grammarterm{conversion-function-id} or
if the single search would find nothing.
\end{note}

\pnum
The \defn{lookup set} for $N$ in $C$, called $S(N,C)$,
consists of two component sets:
the \term{declaration set}, a set of members named $N$; and
the \term{subobject set},
a set of subobjects where declarations of these members were found
(possibly via \grammarterm{using-declaration}{s}).
In the declaration set, type declarations (including injected-class-names)
are replaced by the types they designate. $S(N,C)$ is calculated as follows:

\pnum
The declaration set is the result of
a single search in the scope of $C$ for $N$
from immediately after the \grammarterm{class-specifier} of $C$
if $P$ is in a complete-class context of $C$ or
from $P$ otherwise.
If the resulting declaration set is not empty, the subobject set
contains $C$ itself, and calculation is complete.

\pnum
Otherwise (i.e., $C$ does not contain a declaration of $N$
or the resulting declaration set is empty), $S(N,C)$ is initially empty.
Calculate the lookup set for $N$
in each direct non-dependent\iref{temp.dep.type} base class subobject $B_i$, and
merge each such lookup set $S(N,B_i)$ in turn into $S(N,C)$.
\begin{note}
If $T$ is incomplete,
only base classes whose \grammarterm{base-specifier} appears before $P$
are considered.
If $T$ is an instantiated class, its base classes are not dependent.
\end{note}

\pnum
The following steps define the result of merging lookup set $S(N,B_i)$
into the intermediate $S(N,C)$:

\begin{itemize}
\item If each of the subobject members of $S(N,B_i)$ is a base class
subobject of at least one of the subobject members of $S(N,C)$, or if
$S(N,B_i)$ is empty, $S(N,C)$ is unchanged and the merge is complete.
Conversely, if each of the subobject members of $S(N,C)$ is a base class
subobject of at least one of the subobject members of $S(N,B_i)$, or if
$S(N,C)$ is empty, the new $S(N,C)$ is a copy of $S(N,B_i)$.

\item Otherwise, if the declaration sets of $S(N,B_i)$ and $S(N,C)$
differ, the merge is ambiguous: the new $S(N,C)$ is a lookup set with an
invalid declaration set and the union of the subobject sets. In
subsequent merges, an invalid declaration set is considered different
from any other.

\item Otherwise, the new $S(N,C)$ is a lookup set with the shared set of
declarations and the union of the subobject sets.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The result of the search is the declaration set of $S(N,T)$.
If it is an invalid set, the program is ill-formed.
If it differs from the result of a search in $T$ for $N$
from immediately after the \grammarterm{class-specifier} of $T$,
the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct A { int x; };                    // S(x,A) = \{ \{ \tcode{A::x} \}, \{ \tcode{A} \} \}
struct B { float x; };                  // S(x,B) = \{ \{ \tcode{B::x} \}, \{ \tcode{B} \} \}
struct C: public A, public B { };       // S(x,C) = \{ invalid, \{ \tcode{A} in \tcode{C}, \tcode{B} in \tcode{C} \} \}
struct D: public virtual C { };         // S(x,D) = S(x,C)
struct E: public virtual C { char x; }; // S(x,E) = \{ \{ \tcode{E::x} \}, \{ \tcode{E} \} \}
struct F: public D, public E { };       // S(x,F) = S(x,E)
int main() {
  F f;
  f.x = 0;                              // OK, lookup finds \tcode{E::x}
}
\end{codeblock}

$S(\tcode{x},\tcode{F})$ is unambiguous because the \tcode{A} and \tcode{B} base
class subobjects of \tcode{D} are also base class subobjects of \tcode{E}, so
$S(\tcode{x},\tcode{D})$ is discarded in the first merge step.
\end{example}

\pnum
If $N$ is a non-dependent \grammarterm{conversion-function-id},
conversion function templates that are members of $T$ are considered.
For each such template $F$, the lookup set $S(t,T)$ is constructed,
considering a function template declaration to have the name $t$
only if it corresponds to a declaration of $F$\iref{basic.scope.scope}.
The members of the declaration set of each such lookup set,
which shall not be an invalid set, are included in the result.
\begin{note}
Overload resolution will discard those
that cannot convert to the type specified by $N$\iref{temp.over}.

A static member, a nested type or an enumerator defined in a base class
\tcode{T} can unambiguously be found even if an object has more than one
base class subobject of type \tcode{T}. Two base class subobjects share
the non-static member subobjects of their common virtual base classes.

When virtual base classes are used, a hidden declaration can be reached
along a path through the subobject lattice that does not pass through
the hiding declaration. This is not an ambiguity. The identical use with
non-virtual base classes is an ambiguity; in that case there is no
unique instance of the name that hides all the others.

\begin{itemize}

declaration of a class member, or

then lookup for the name also includes the result of
\defnadj{argument-dependent}{lookup} in a set of associated namespaces
that depends on the types of the arguments
(and for template template arguments, the namespace of the template argument),
as specified below.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}

}

\end{example}

\pnum
\begin{note}
For purposes of determining
(during parsing) whether an expression is a
\grammarterm{postfix-expression} for a function call, the usual name lookup
rules apply.
In some cases
a name followed by \tcode{<} is treated as a \grammarterm{template-name}
even though name lookup did not find a \grammarterm{template-name}
(see \ref{temp.names}).
For example,
\begin{codeblock}
int h;
void g();
namespace N {
  struct A {};
  template <class T> int f(T);
  template <class T> int g(T);
  template <class T> int h(T);
}

int x = f<N::A>(N::A());        // OK: lookup of \tcode{f} finds nothing, \tcode{f} treated as template name
int y = g<N::A>(N::A());        // OK: lookup of \tcode{g} finds a function, \tcode{g} treated as template name
int z = h<N::A>(N::A());        // error: \tcode{h<} does not begin a \grammarterm{template-id}
\end{codeblock}

The rules have no effect on the syntactic interpretation of an expression.
For example,
\begin{codeblock}
typedef int f;
namespace N {
  struct A {
    friend void f(A &);
    operator int();
    void g(A a) {
      int i = f(a);             // \tcode{f} is the typedef, not the friend function: equivalent to \tcode{int(a)}
    }
  };
}
\end{codeblock}
Because the expression is not a function call,
argument-dependent name lookup does not apply and
the friend function \tcode{f} is not found.
\end{note}

\pnum
For each argument type \tcode{T} in the function call,
there is a set of zero or more \defnx{associated entities}{entity!associated}
to be considered.
The set of entities is determined entirely by
the types of the function arguments
(and any template template arguments).
Typedef names and \grammarterm{using-declaration}{s}
used to specify the types
do not contribute to this set.
The set of entities
is determined in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item If \tcode{T} is a fundamental type, its associated set of
entities is empty.

\item If \tcode{T} is a class type (including unions),
its associated entities are:
the class itself;
the class of which it is a member, if any;
and its direct and indirect base classes.
Furthermore, if \tcode{T} is a class template specialization,
its associated entities also include:
the entities
associated with the types of the template arguments
provided for template type parameters;
the templates used as template template arguments; and
the classes of which any member templates used as template template
arguments are members.
\begin{note}
Non-type template arguments do not
contribute to the set of associated entities.
\end{note}

\item If \tcode{T} is an enumeration type,
its associated entities are \tcode{T}
and, if it is a class member, the member's class.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to \tcode{U} or an array of \tcode{U},
its associated entities are those associated with \tcode{U}.

\item If \tcode{T} is a function type, its associated
entities are those associated with the function parameter types and those
associated with the return type.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a member function of a class
\tcode{X}, its associated entities are those associated
with the function parameter types and return type, together with those
associated with \tcode{X}.

\item If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a data member of class \tcode{X}, its
associated entities are those associated with the member
type together with those associated with \tcode{X}.
\end{itemize}
In addition, if the argument is an overload set or the address of such a set,
its associated entities
are the union of those associated with each of the
members of the set, i.e., the entities associated with its
parameter types and return type.
Additionally, if the aforementioned overload set is named with
a \grammarterm{template-id}, its associated entities also include
its template \grammarterm{template-argument}{s} and
those associated with its type \grammarterm{template-argument}s.

\pnum
The \term{associated namespaces} for a call are
the innermost enclosing non-inline namespaces for its associated entities
as well as every element of the inline namespace set\iref{namespace.def}
of those namespaces.
Argument-dependent lookup finds
all declarations of functions and function templates that
\begin{itemize}
\item
are found by a search of any associated namespace, or
\item
are declared as a friend\iref{class.friend} of any class
with a reachable definition in the set of associated entities, or
\item
are exported,
are attached to a named module \tcode{M}\iref{module.interface},
do not appear in the translation unit containing the point of the lookup, and
have the same innermost enclosing non-inline namespace scope as
a declaration of an associated entity attached to \tcode{M}\iref{basic.link}.
\end{itemize}
If the lookup is for a dependent name (\ref{temp.dep}, \ref{temp.dep.candidate}),
the above lookup is also performed
from each point in the instantiation context\iref{module.context} of the lookup,
additionally ignoring any declaration that
appears in another translation unit,
is attached to the global module, and
is either discarded\iref{module.global.frag} or has internal linkage.

Lookup of an \grammarterm{identifier}

considers only
namespaces, types, and templates whose specializations are types.
If a name, \grammarterm{template-id}, or \grammarterm{decltype-specifier}
is followed by a \tcode{::},
it shall designate a namespace, class, enumeration, or dependent type,
and the \tcode{::} is never interpreted as
a complete \grammarterm{nested-name-specifier}.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}

A member-qualified name is

The \defn{lookup context} of a member-qualified name is
the type of its associated object expression
(considered dependent if the object expression is type-dependent).
The lookup context of any other qualified name is
the type, template, or namespace
nominated by the preceding \grammarterm{nested-name-specifier}.
\begin{note}
When parsing a class member access,
the name following the \tcode{->} or \tcode{.} is
a qualified name even though it is not yet known of which kind.

the number of which is \impldef{bits in a byte}. The least

A \defn{memory location} is either an object of scalar type that is not a bit-field

Various
features of the language, such as references and virtual functions, might
involve additional memory locations that are not accessible to programs but are
managed by the implementation.

Two or more threads of
execution\iref{intro.multithread} can access separate memory
locations without interfering with each other.

\pnum
\begin{note}
Thus a bit-field and an adjacent non-bit-field are in separate memory
locations, and therefore can be concurrently updated by two threads of execution
without interference. The same applies to two bit-fields, if one is declared
inside a nested struct declaration and the other is not, or if the two are
separated by a zero-length bit-field declaration, or if they are separated by a
non-bit-field declaration. It is not safe to concurrently update two bit-fields
in the same struct if all fields between them are also bit-fields of nonzero
width.

The constructs in a \Cpp{} program create, destroy, refer to, access, and

An \defn{object} is created
by a definition\iref{basic.def},
by a \grammarterm{new-expression}\iref{expr.new},
by an operation that implicitly creates objects (see below),
when implicitly changing the active member of a union\iref{class.union},
or
when a temporary object is created~(\ref{conv.rval}, \ref{class.temporary}).
An object occupies a region of storage
in its period of construction\iref{class.cdtor},
throughout its lifetime\iref{basic.life},
and
in its period of destruction\iref{class.cdtor}.
\begin{note}
A function is not an object, regardless of whether or not it
occupies storage in the way that objects do.
\end{note}
The properties of an
object are determined when the object is created. An object can have a
name\iref{basic.pre}. An object has a storage
duration\iref{basic.stc} which influences its
lifetime\iref{basic.life}. An object has a
type\iref{basic.types}.

Two objects

\indextext{object lifetime|(}%
The \defn{lifetime} of an object or reference is a runtime property of the
object or reference.
A variable is said to have \defnadj{vacuous}{initialization}
if it is default-initialized and,
if it is of class type or a (possibly multi-dimensional) array thereof,
that class type has a trivial default constructor.
The lifetime of an object of type \tcode{T} begins when:
\begin{itemize}
\item storage with the proper alignment and size
  for type \tcode{T} is obtained, and
\item its initialization (if any) is complete
  (including vacuous initialization)\iref{dcl.init},

except that if the object is a union member or subobject thereof,
its lifetime only begins if that union member is the
initialized member in the union~(\ref{dcl.init.aggr}, \ref{class.base.init}),
or as described in \ref{class.union} and \ref{class.copy.ctor},
and except as described in \ref{allocator.members}.
The lifetime of an object \placeholder{o} of type \tcode{T} ends when:
\begin{itemize}
\item if \tcode{T} is a non-class type, the object is destroyed, or
\item if \tcode{T} is a class type, the destructor call starts, or

The properties ascribed to objects and references throughout this document

\begin{note}
In particular, before the lifetime of an object starts and after its
lifetime ends there are significant restrictions on the use of the
object, as described below, in~\ref{class.base.init} and
in~\ref{class.cdtor}. Also, the behavior of an object under construction
and destruction can differ from the behavior of an object whose
lifetime has started and not ended. \ref{class.base.init}
and~\ref{class.cdtor} describe the behavior of an object during its periods
of construction and destruction.
\end{note}

\pnum
A program may end the lifetime of any object by reusing the storage
which the object occupies or by explicitly calling a destructor
or pseudo-destructor\iref{expr.prim.id.dtor} for the object.
For an object of a class type, the program is not required to
call the destructor explicitly before the storage which the object
occupies is reused or released; however, if there is no explicit call to
the destructor or if a \grammarterm{delete-expression}\iref{expr.delete}
is not used to release the storage, the destructor is not
implicitly called and any program that depends on the side effects
produced by the destructor has undefined behavior.

\pnum
Before the lifetime of an object has started but after the storage which
the object will occupy has been allocated

For example, before the dynamic initialization of
an object with static storage duration\iref{basic.start.dynamic}.

or, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage
which the object occupied is reused or released, any pointer that represents the address of
the storage location where the object will be or was located may be
used but only in limited ways.
For an object under construction or destruction, see~\ref{class.cdtor}.
Otherwise, such
a pointer refers to allocated
storage\iref{basic.stc.dynamic.allocation}, and using the pointer as
if the pointer were of type \tcode{\keyword{void}*} is
well-defined. Indirection through such a pointer is permitted but the resulting lvalue may only be used in
limited ways, as described below. The
program has undefined behavior if:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  the object will be or was of a class type with a non-trivial destructor
  and the pointer is used as the operand of a \grammarterm{delete-expression},
\item
  the pointer is used to access a non-static data member or call a
  non-static member function of the object, or
\item
  the pointer is implicitly converted\iref{conv.ptr} to a pointer
  to a virtual base class, or
\item
  the pointer is used as the operand of a
  \keyword{static_cast}\iref{expr.static.cast}, except when the conversion

If, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage

original object, or the name of the original object will automatically
refer to the new object and, once the lifetime of the new object has

the original object is transparently replaceable (see below)

An object $o_1$ is \defn{transparently replaceable}
by an object $o_2$ if:
\begin{itemize}

first parameter shall not have an associated default
argument\iref{dcl.fct.default}. The value of the first parameter
is interpreted as the requested size of the allocation. An allocation
function can be a function template. Such a template shall declare its
return type and first parameter as specified above (that is, template
parameter types shall not be used in the return type and first parameter
type). Allocation function templates shall have two or more parameters.

\pnum
An allocation function attempts to allocate the requested amount of
storage. If it is successful, it returns the address of the start
of a block of storage whose length in bytes is at least as large
as the requested size.
The order,
contiguity, and initial value of storage allocated by successive calls
to an allocation function are unspecified.
Even if the size of the space
requested is zero, the request can fail. If the request succeeds, the
value returned by a replaceable allocation function
is a non-null pointer value\iref{basic.compound}
\tcode{p0} different from any previously returned value \tcode{p1},
unless that value \tcode{p1} was subsequently passed to a
replaceable deallocation function.
Furthermore, for the library allocation functions
in~\ref{new.delete.single} and~\ref{new.delete.array},
\tcode{p0} represents the address of a block of storage disjoint from the storage
for any other object accessible to the caller.
The effect of indirecting through a pointer
returned from a request for zero size is undefined.
\begin{footnote}
The intent is
to have \tcode{\keyword{operator} \keyword{new}()} implementable by
calling \tcode{std::malloc()} or \tcode{std::calloc()}, so the rules are

  of type \tcode{std::align_val_t},
  the storage will have the alignment specified
  by the value of this argument.
\item
  Otherwise, if the allocation function is named \tcode{\keyword{operator} \keyword{new}[]},
  the storage is aligned for any object that
  does not have new-extended alignment\iref{basic.align} and

Object types have \defnx{alignment requirements}{alignment requirement!implementation-defined}~(\ref{basic.fundamental}, \ref{basic.compound})

at which a given object can be allocated. An object type imposes an alignment
requirement on every object of that type; stricter alignment can be requested
using the alignment specifier\iref{dcl.align}.

A \defnadj{fundamental}{alignment} is represented by an alignment
less than or equal to the greatest alignment supported by the implementation in
all contexts, which is equal to
\tcode{\keyword{alignof}(std::max_align_t)}\iref{support.types}.
The alignment required for a type may be different when it is used as the type
of a complete object and when it is used as the type of a subobject.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct B { long double d; };
struct D : virtual B { char c; };
\end{codeblock}

When \tcode{D} is the type of a complete object, it will have a subobject of
type \tcode{B}, so it must be aligned appropriately for a \tcode{\keyword{long} \keyword{double}}.
If \tcode{D} appears as a subobject of another object that also has \tcode{B}
as a virtual base class, the \tcode{B} subobject might be part of a different
subobject, reducing the alignment requirements on the \tcode{D} subobject.
\end{example}
The result of the \keyword{alignof} operator reflects the alignment
requirement of the type in the complete-object case.

\pnum
An \defnadj{extended}{alignment} is represented by an alignment
greater than \tcode{\keyword{alignof}(std::max_align_t)}. It is \impldef{support for extended alignments}
whether any extended alignments are supported and the contexts in which they are
supported\iref{dcl.align}. A type having an extended alignment
requirement is an \defnadj{over-aligned}{type}.
\begin{note}
Every over-aligned type is or contains a class type
to which extended alignment applies (possibly through a non-static data member).
\end{note}
A \defnadj{new-extended}{alignment} is represented by
an alignment greater than \mname{STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT}\iref{cpp.predefined}.

Alignments are represented as values of the type \tcode{std::size_t}.
Valid alignments include only those values returned by an \keyword{alignof}
expression for the fundamental types plus an additional \impldef{alignment additional

set of values, which may be empty.
Every alignment value shall be a non-negative integral power of two.

\pnum
Alignments have an order from \defnx{weaker}{alignment!weaker} to
\defnx{stronger}{alignment!stronger} or \defnx{stricter}{alignment!stricter} alignments. Stricter
alignments have larger alignment values. An address that satisfies an alignment
requirement also satisfies any weaker valid alignment requirement.

\pnum
The alignment requirement of a complete type can be queried using an
\keyword{alignof} expression\iref{expr.alignof}. Furthermore,
the narrow character types\iref{basic.fundamental} shall have the weakest
alignment requirement.
\begin{note}
This enables the ordinary character types to be used as the
underlying type for an aligned memory area\iref{dcl.align}.
\end{note}

\pnum
Comparing alignments is meaningful and provides the obvious results:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two alignments are equal when their numeric values are equal.
\item Two alignments are different when their numeric values are not equal.
\item When an alignment is larger than another it represents a stricter alignment.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
\begin{note}
The runtime pointer alignment function\iref{ptr.align}
can be used to obtain an aligned pointer within a buffer; the aligned-storage templates
in the library\iref{meta.trans.other} can be used to obtain aligned storage.

class Y {

\tcode{X(2)} is constructed in the space used to hold \tcode{f()}'s argument and

Likewise,
\tcode{f()}'s result is constructed directly in \tcode{b} and
\tcode{g()}'s result is constructed directly in \tcode{c}.
On the other hand, the expression
\tcode{a = f(a)}
requires a temporary for
the result of \tcode{f(a)},
which is materialized so that the reference parameter
of \tcode{X::operator=(const X\&)} can bind to it.

When an object of class type \tcode{X}
is passed to or returned from a function,
if \tcode{X} has at least one eligible copy or move constructor\iref{special},
each such constructor is trivial,
and the destructor of \tcode{X} is either trivial or deleted,
implementations are permitted
to create a temporary object
to hold the function parameter or result object.
The temporary object is constructed
from the function argument or return value, respectively,
and the function's parameter or return object
is initialized as if by
using the eligible trivial constructor to copy the temporary
(even if that constructor is inaccessible
or would not be selected by overload resolution
to perform a copy or move of the object).

When an implementation introduces a temporary object of a class that has a
non-trivial constructor~(\ref{class.default.ctor}, \ref{class.copy.ctor}),
it shall ensure that a constructor is called for the temporary object.
Similarly, the destructor shall be called for a temporary with a non-trivial
destructor\iref{class.dtor}.
Temporary objects are destroyed as the last step
in evaluating
the full-expression\iref{intro.execution}
that (lexically) contains the point where
they were created.
This is true even if that evaluation ends in throwing an exception.

\indextext{initializer!temporary and declarator}%

There are three contexts in which temporaries are destroyed at a different
point than the end of the full-expression.
The first context is when a default constructor is called to initialize
an element of an array with no corresponding initializer\iref{dcl.init}.
The second context is when a copy constructor is called to copy an element of
an array while the entire array is copied~(\ref{expr.prim.lambda.capture}, \ref{class.copy.ctor}).
In either case, if the constructor has one or more default arguments,
the destruction of every temporary created in a default argument is
sequenced before the construction of the next array element, if any.

\pnum
The third context is when a reference is bound to a
temporary object.
\begin{footnote}
The same rules apply to initialization of an
  \tcode{initializer_list} object\iref{dcl.init.list} with its
  underlying temporary array.
\end{footnote}
The temporary object to which the reference is bound or the temporary object
that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound
persists for the lifetime of the reference if the glvalue
to which the reference is bound
was obtained through one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  a temporary materialization conversion\iref{conv.rval},
\item
  \tcode{(} \grammarterm{expression} \tcode{)},
  where \grammarterm{expression} is one of these expressions,
\item
  subscripting\iref{expr.sub} of an array operand,
  where that operand is one of these expressions,
\item
  a class member access\iref{expr.ref} using the \tcode{.} operator
  where the left operand is one of these expressions and
  the right operand designates a non-static data member of non-reference type,
\item
  a pointer-to-member operation\iref{expr.mptr.oper} using the \tcode{.*} operator
  where the left operand is one of these expressions and
  the right operand is a pointer to data member of non-reference type,
\item
  a
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \keyword{const_cast}\iref{expr.const.cast},
  \item \keyword{static_cast}\iref{expr.static.cast},
  \item \keyword{dynamic_cast}\iref{expr.dynamic.cast}, or
  \item \keyword{reinterpret_cast}\iref{expr.reinterpret.cast}
  \end{itemize}
  converting, without a user-defined conversion,
  a glvalue operand that is one of these expressions
  to a glvalue that refers
  to the object designated by the operand, or
  to its complete object or a subobject thereof,
\item
  a conditional expression\iref{expr.cond} that is a glvalue
  where the second or third operand is one of these expressions, or
\item
  a comma expression\iref{expr.comma} that is a glvalue
  where the right operand is one of these expressions.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
template<typename T> using id = T;

int i = 1;
int&& a = id<int[3]>{1, 2, 3}[i];           // temporary array has same lifetime as \tcode{a}
const int& b = static_cast<const int&>(0);  // temporary \tcode{int} has same lifetime as \tcode{b}
int&& c = cond ? id<int[3]>{1, 2, 3}[i] : static_cast<int&&>(0);
                                            // exactly one of the two temporaries is lifetime-extended
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
An explicit type conversion~(\ref{expr.type.conv}, \ref{expr.cast})
is interpreted as
a sequence of elementary casts,
covered above.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
const int& x = (const int&)1;   // temporary for value 1 has same lifetime as x
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{note}
\begin{note}
If a temporary object has a reference member initialized by another temporary object,
lifetime extension applies recursively to such a member's initializer.
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  const int& m;
};
const S& s = S{1};              // both \tcode{S} and \tcode{int} temporaries have lifetime of \tcode{s}
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{note}

The exceptions to this lifetime rule are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A temporary object bound to a reference parameter in a function call\iref{expr.call}
persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the call.

\item A temporary object bound to a reference element of
an aggregate of class type initialized from
a parenthesized \grammarterm{expression-list}\iref{dcl.init}
persists until the completion of the full-expression
containing the \grammarterm{expression-list}.

\item The lifetime of a temporary bound to the returned value in a function \tcode{return} statement\iref{stmt.return} is not extended; the temporary is destroyed at the end of the full-expression in the \tcode{return} statement.

\item A temporary bound to a reference in a \grammarterm{new-initializer}\iref{expr.new} persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the \grammarterm{new-initializer}.
\begin{note}
This might introduce a dangling reference.
\end{note}
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S { int mi; const std::pair<int,int>& mp; };
S a { 1, {2,3} };
S* p = new S{ 1, {2,3} };       // creates dangling reference
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The destruction of a temporary whose lifetime is not extended by being
bound to a reference is sequenced before the destruction of every
temporary which is constructed earlier in the same full-expression.
If the lifetime of two or more temporaries to which references are bound ends
at the same point,
these temporaries are destroyed at that point in the reverse order of the
completion of their construction.
In addition, the destruction of temporaries bound to references shall
take into account the ordering of destruction of objects with static, thread, or
automatic storage duration~(\ref{basic.stc.static}, \ref{basic.stc.thread}, \ref{basic.stc.auto});
that is, if
\tcode{obj1}
is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created before the temporary is created
the temporary shall be destroyed before
\tcode{obj1}
is destroyed;
if
\tcode{obj2}
is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created after the temporary is created
the temporary shall be destroyed after
\tcode{obj2}
is destroyed.

\pnum
\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
struct S {
  S();
  S(int);
  friend S operator+(const S&, const S&);
  ~S();
};
S obj1;
const S& cr = S(16)+S(23);
S obj2;
\end{codeblock}

The expression
\tcode{S(16) + S(23)}
creates three temporaries:
a first temporary
\tcode{T1}
to hold the result of the expression
\tcode{S(16)},
a second temporary
\tcode{T2}
to hold the result of the expression
\tcode{S(23)},
and a third temporary
\tcode{T3}
to hold the result of the addition of these two expressions.
The temporary
\tcode{T3}
is then bound to the reference
\tcode{cr}.
It is unspecified whether
\tcode{T1}
or
\tcode{T2}
is created first.
On an implementation where
\tcode{T1}
is created before
\tcode{T2},
\tcode{T2}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{T1}.
The temporaries
\tcode{T1}
and
\tcode{T2}
are bound to the reference parameters of
\tcode{\keyword{operator}+};
these temporaries are destroyed at the end of the full-expression
containing the call to
\tcode{\keyword{operator}+}.
The temporary
\tcode{T3}
bound to the reference
\tcode{cr}
is destroyed at the end of
\tcode{cr}'s
lifetime, that is, at the end of the program.
In addition, the order in which
\tcode{T3}
is destroyed takes into account the destruction order of other objects with
static storage duration.
That is, because
\tcode{obj1}
is constructed before
\tcode{T3},
and
\tcode{T3}
is constructed before
\tcode{obj2},
\tcode{obj2}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{T3},
and
\tcode{T3}
shall be destroyed before
\tcode{obj1}.

Compound types can be constructed in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item \defnx{arrays}{type!array} of objects of a given type, \ref{dcl.array};

\item \defnx{functions}{type!function}, which have parameters of given types and return
\keyword{void} or references or objects of a given type, \ref{dcl.fct};

\item \defnx{pointers}{type!pointer} to \cv{}~\keyword{void} or objects or functions (including
static members of classes) of a given type, \ref{dcl.ptr};

\item
\indextext{reference!lvalue}%
\indextext{reference!rvalue}%
\defnx{references}{reference} to objects or functions of a given
type, \ref{dcl.ref}. There are two types of references:
\begin{itemize}
\item lvalue reference
\item rvalue reference
\end{itemize}

\item
\defnx{classes}{class} containing a sequence of objects of various types\iref{class},
a set of types, enumerations and functions for
manipulating these objects\iref{class.mfct}, and a set of restrictions
on the access to these entities\iref{class.access};

\item
\defnx{unions}{\idxcode{union}}, which are classes capable of containing objects of
different types at different times, \ref{class.union};

\item
\defnx{enumerations}{\idxcode{enum}}, which comprise a set of named constant values.
Each distinct enumeration constitutes a different
\defnadj{enumerated}{type}, \ref{dcl.enum};

\item
\indextext{member pointer to|see{pointer to member}}%
\defnx{pointers to non-static class members}{pointer to member},%
\begin{footnote}
Static class members are objects or functions, and pointers to them are
ordinary pointers to objects or functions.
\end{footnote}
which identify members of a given
type within objects of a given class, \ref{dcl.mptr}.
Pointers to data members and pointers to member functions are collectively
called \term{pointer-to-member} types.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
These methods of constructing types can be applied recursively;
restrictions are mentioned in~\ref{dcl.meaning}.
Constructing a type such that the number of
bytes in its object representation exceeds the maximum value representable in
the type \tcode{std::size_t}\iref{support.types} is ill-formed.

\pnum
\indextext{terminology!pointer}%
The type of a pointer to \cv{}~\keyword{void} or a pointer to an object type is
called an \defn{object pointer type}.
\begin{note}
A pointer to \keyword{void}
does not have a pointer-to-object type, however, because \keyword{void} is not
an object type.
\end{note}
The type of a pointer that can designate a function
is called a \defn{function pointer type}.
A pointer to an object of type \tcode{T} is referred to as a ``pointer to
\tcode{T}''.
\begin{example}
A pointer to an object of type \keyword{int} is
referred to as ``pointer to \keyword{int}'' and a pointer to an object of
class \tcode{X} is called a ``pointer to \tcode{X}''.
\end{example}
Except for pointers to static members, text referring to ``pointers''
does not apply to pointers to members. Pointers to incomplete types are
allowed although there are restrictions on what can be done with
them\iref{basic.align}.
\indextext{address}%
Every value of pointer type is one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
a \defn{pointer to} an object or function (the pointer is said to \defn{point} to the object or function), or
\item
a \defn{pointer past the end of} an object\iref{expr.add}, or
\item
\indextext{null pointer value|see{value, null pointer}}
the \defnx{null pointer value}{value!null pointer} for that type, or
\item
\indextext{invalid pointer value|see{value, invalid pointer}}
an \defnx{invalid pointer value}{value!invalid pointer}.
\end{itemize}
A value of a
pointer type
that is a pointer to or past the end of an object
\defn{represents the address} of
the first byte in memory\iref{intro.memory} occupied by the object
\begin{footnote}
For an object that is not within its lifetime,
this is the first byte in memory that it will occupy or used to occupy.
\end{footnote}
or the first byte in memory
after the end of the storage occupied by the object,
respectively.
\begin{note}
A pointer past the end of an object\iref{expr.add}
is not considered to point to an unrelated object
of the object's type,
even if the unrelated object is located at that address.
A pointer value becomes invalid
when the storage it denotes
reaches the end of its storage duration;
see \ref{basic.stc}.
\end{note}
For purposes of pointer arithmetic\iref{expr.add}
and comparison~(\ref{expr.rel}, \ref{expr.eq}),
a pointer past the end of the last element of
an array \tcode{x} of $n$ elements
is considered to be equivalent to
a pointer to a hypothetical array element $n$ of \tcode{x} and
an object of type \tcode{T} that is not an array element
is considered to belong to an array with one element of type \tcode{T}.
The value representation of
pointer types is \impldef{value representation of pointer types}. Pointers to
layout-compatible types shall
have the same value representation and alignment
requirements\iref{basic.align}.
\begin{note}
Pointers to over-aligned types\iref{basic.align} have no special
representation, but their range of valid values is restricted by the extended
alignment requirement.
\end{note}

\pnum
Two objects \placeholder{a} and \placeholder{b} are \defn{pointer-interconvertible} if:
\begin{itemize}
\item
they are the same object, or
\item
one is a union object and
the other is a non-static data member of that object\iref{class.union}, or
\item
one is a standard-layout class object and
the other is the first non-static data member of that object, or,
if the object has no non-static data members,
any base class subobject of that object\iref{class.mem}, or
\item
there exists an object \placeholder{c} such that
\placeholder{a} and \placeholder{c} are pointer-interconvertible, and
\placeholder{c} and \placeholder{b} are pointer-interconvertible.
\end{itemize}
If two objects are pointer-interconvertible,
then they have the same address,
and it is possible to obtain a pointer to one
from a pointer to the other
via a \keyword{reinterpret_cast}\iref{expr.reinterpret.cast}.
\begin{note}
An array object and its first element are not pointer-interconvertible,
even though they have the same address.

a \defn{volatile-qualified} version, and
a \defn{const-volatile-qualified} version.
The types in each such group shall have
the same representation and alignment requirements\iref{basic.align}.
\begin{footnote}
The same representation and alignment requirements
are meant to imply interchangeability as
arguments to functions,
return values from functions, and
non-static data members of unions.

A function or reference type is always cv-unqualified.
\begin{itemize}

\item A \defnadj{volatile}{object} is an object of type

  \tcode{\keyword{const} \keyword{volatile} T}, a non-mutable subobject of a const volatile object,
  a const subobject of a volatile object, or a non-mutable volatile
  subobject of a const object.

an array whose elements are so-qualified\iref{dcl.array}.

typedef char CA[5];
typedef const char CC;
CC arr1[5] = { 0 };
const CA arr2 = { 0 };

For a type \cv{}~\tcode{T}, the \defnx{top-level cv-qualifiers}{cv-qualifier!top-level}

a use of the language construct is considered to be an expression

environment. \defnx{Evaluation}{evaluation} of an expression (or a
subexpression) in general includes both value computations (including
determining the identity of an object for glvalue evaluation and fetching
a value previously assigned to an object for prvalue evaluation) and
initiation of side effects. When a call to a library I/O function
returns or an access through a volatile glvalue is evaluated the side

\pnum
\defnx{Sequenced before}{sequenced before} is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between
evaluations executed by a single thread\iref{intro.multithread}, which induces
a partial order among those evaluations. Given any two evaluations \placeholder{A} and
\placeholder{B}, if \placeholder{A} is sequenced before \placeholder{B}
(or, equivalently, \placeholder{B} is \defn{sequenced after} \placeholder{A}),
then the execution of
\placeholder{A} shall precede the execution of \placeholder{B}. If \placeholder{A} is not sequenced
before \placeholder{B} and \placeholder{B} is not sequenced before \placeholder{A}, then \placeholder{A} and
\placeholder{B} are \defn{unsequenced}.
\begin{note}
The execution of unsequenced
evaluations can overlap.
\end{note}
Evaluations \placeholder{A} and \placeholder{B} are
\defn{indeterminately sequenced} when either \placeholder{A} is sequenced before
\placeholder{B} or \placeholder{B} is sequenced before \placeholder{A}, but it is unspecified which.
\begin{note}
Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but either
can be executed first.
\end{note}
An expression \placeholder{X}
is said to be sequenced before
an expression \placeholder{Y} if
every value computation and every side effect

every value computation and every side effect

As specified

Except where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and

In an expression that is evaluated more than once during the execution

its subexpressions need not be performed consistently in different
evaluations.
\end{note}
The value computations of the operands of an
operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the
operator. If a

side effect on a memory location\iref{intro.memory} is unsequenced
relative to either another side effect on the same memory location or
a value computation using the value of any object in the same memory location,
and they are not potentially concurrent\iref{intro.multithread},
the behavior is undefined.
\begin{note}
The next subclause imposes similar, but more complex restrictions on
potentially concurrent computations.
\end{note}

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
void g(int i) {
  i = 7, i++, i++;              // \tcode{i} becomes \tcode{9}

  i = i++ + 1;                  // the value of \tcode{i} is incremented

\pnum
When invoking a function (whether or not the function is inline),
every argument expression and
the postfix expression designating the called function
are sequenced before every expression or statement
in the body of the called function.
For each function invocation or
evaluation of an \grammarterm{await-expression} \placeholder{F},
each evaluation that does not occur within \placeholder{F} but
is evaluated on the same thread and as part of the same signal handler (if any)
is either sequenced before all evaluations that occur within \placeholder{F}
or sequenced after all evaluations that occur within \placeholder{F};
\begin{footnote}
In other words,
function executions do not interleave with each other.
\end{footnote}
if \placeholder{F} invokes or resumes a coroutine\iref{expr.await},
only evaluations
subsequent to the previous suspension (if any) and
prior to the next suspension (if any)
are considered to occur within \placeholder{F}.

Several contexts in \Cpp{} cause evaluation of a function call, even
though no corresponding function call syntax appears in the translation
unit.
\begin{example}
Evaluation of a \grammarterm{new-expression} invokes one or more allocation
and constructor functions; see~\ref{expr.new}. For another example,
invocation of a conversion function\iref{class.conv.fct} can arise in
contexts in which no function call syntax appears.
\end{example}
The sequencing constraints on the execution of the called function (as
described above) are features of the function calls as evaluated,
regardless of the syntax of the expression that calls the function.%

If a signal handler is executed as a result of a call to the \tcode{std::raise}

When a signal is received for another reason, the execution of the
signal handler is usually unsequenced with respect to the rest of the program.

A \defn{thread of execution} (also known as a \defn{thread}) is a single flow of

top-level function, and recursively including every function invocation
subsequently executed by the thread.
\begin{note}
When one thread creates another,
the initial call to the top-level function of the new thread is executed by the
new thread, not by the creating thread.
\end{note}
Every thread in a program can
potentially access every object and function in a program.
\begin{footnote}
An object
with automatic or thread storage duration\iref{basic.stc} is associated with
one specific thread, and can be accessed by a different thread only indirectly
through a pointer or reference\iref{basic.compound}.
\end{footnote}
Under a hosted
implementation, a \Cpp{} program can have more than one thread running
concurrently. The execution of each thread proceeds as defined by the remainder
of this document. The execution of the entire program consists of an execution
of all of its threads.
\begin{note}
Usually the execution can be viewed as an
interleaving of all its threads. However, some kinds of atomic operations, for
example, allow executions inconsistent with a simple interleaving, as described
below.

The value of an object visible to a thread $T$ at a particular point is the

\begin{note}
In some cases, there might instead be undefined behavior. Much of this
subclause is motivated by the desire to support atomic operations with explicit

simpler view for more restricted programs.
\end{note}

\pnum
Two expression evaluations \defn{conflict} if one of them modifies a memory
location\iref{intro.memory} and the other one reads or modifies the same
memory location.

\pnum
The library defines a number of atomic operations\iref{atomics} and
operations on mutexes\iref{thread} that are specially identified as
synchronization operations. These operations play a special role in making
assignments in one thread visible to another. A synchronization operation on one
or more memory locations is either a consume operation, an acquire operation, a
release operation, or both an acquire and release operation. A synchronization
operation without an associated memory location is a fence and can be either an
acquire fence, a release fence, or both an acquire and release fence. In
addition, there are relaxed atomic operations, which are not synchronization
operations, and atomic read-modify-write operations, which have special
characteristics.
\begin{note}
For example, a call that acquires a mutex will
perform an acquire operation on the locations comprising the mutex.
Correspondingly, a call that releases the same mutex will perform a release
operation on those same locations. Informally, performing a release operation on
$A$ forces prior
\indextext{side effects}%
side effects on other memory locations to become visible
to other threads that later perform a consume or an acquire operation on
$A$. ``Relaxed'' atomic operations are not synchronization operations even
though, like synchronization operations, they cannot contribute to data races.
\end{note}

\pnum
All modifications to a particular atomic object $M$ occur in some
particular total order, called the \defn{modification order} of $M$.
\begin{note}
There is a separate order for each
atomic object. There is no requirement that these can be combined into a single
total order for all objects. In general this will be impossible since different
threads can observe modifications to different objects in inconsistent orders.
\end{note}

\pnum
A \defn{release sequence} headed
by a release operation $A$ on an atomic object $M$
is a maximal contiguous sub-sequence of
\indextext{side effects}%
side effects in the modification order of $M$,
where the first operation is $A$, and
every subsequent operation is an atomic read-modify-write operation.

\pnum
Certain library calls \defn{synchronize with} other library calls performed by
another thread. For example, an atomic store-release synchronizes with a
load-acquire that takes its value from the store\iref{atomics.order}.
\begin{note}
Except in the specified cases, reading a later value does not
necessarily ensure visibility as described below. Such a requirement would
sometimes interfere with efficient implementation.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
The
specifications of the synchronization operations define when one reads the value
written by another. For atomic objects, the definition is clear. All operations
on a given mutex occur in a single total order. Each mutex acquisition ``reads
the value written'' by the last mutex release.

the value written by $A$, or

\item
for some evaluation $X$, $A$ is dependency-ordered before $X$ and
$X$ carries a dependency to $B$.

\begin{note}
The ``inter-thread happens before'' relation describes arbitrary
concatenations of ``sequenced before'', ``synchronizes with'' and
``dependency-ordered before'' relationships, with two exceptions. The first
exception is that a concatenation is not permitted to end with
``dependency-ordered before'' followed by ``sequenced before''. The reason for
this limitation is that a consume operation participating in a
``dependency-ordered before'' relationship provides ordering only with respect
to operations to which this consume operation actually carries a dependency. The
reason that this limitation applies only to the end of such a concatenation is
that any subsequent release operation will provide the required ordering for a
prior consume operation. The second exception is that a concatenation is not
permitted to consist entirely of ``sequenced before''. The reasons for this
limitation are (1) to permit ``inter-thread happens before'' to be transitively
closed and (2) the ``happens before'' relation, defined below, provides for
relationships consisting entirely of ``sequenced before''.

potentially concurrent conflicting actions, at least one of which is not atomic,

Any such data race results in undefined
behavior.
\begin{note}
It can be shown that programs that correctly use mutexes
and \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} operations to prevent all data races and use no
other synchronization operations behave as if the operations executed by their
constituent threads were simply interleaved, with each
\indextext{value computation}%
value computation of an

side effect on that object in that
interleaving. This is normally referred to as ``sequential consistency''.
However, this applies only to data-race-free programs, and data-race-free
programs cannot observe most program transformations that do not change
single-threaded program semantics. In fact, most single-threaded program
transformations continue to be allowed, since any program that behaves
differently as a result has undefined behavior.

$B$ happen before evaluations in $A$, and the

all evaluations in $A$ happened before the execution of the signal

\pnum
\begin{note}
Compiler transformations that introduce assignments to a potentially
shared memory location that would not be modified by the abstract machine are
generally precluded by this document, since such an assignment might overwrite
another assignment by a different thread in cases in which an abstract machine
execution would not have encountered a data race. This includes implementations
of data member assignment that overwrite adjacent members in separate memory
locations. Reordering of atomic loads in cases in which the atomics in question
might alias is also generally precluded, since this could violate the coherence
rules.

\pnum
\begin{note}
Transformations that introduce a speculative read of a potentially
shared memory location might not preserve the semantics of the \Cpp{} program as
defined in this document, since they potentially introduce a data race. However,
they are typically valid in the context of an optimizing compiler that targets a
specific machine with well-defined semantics for data races. They would be
invalid for a hypothetical machine that is not tolerant of races or provides
hardware race detection.

is at least as strong as $P$'s forward progress guarantees.
\begin{note}
It is unspecified which thread or threads of execution in $S$ are chosen
and for which number of execution steps. The strengthening is not permanent and
not necessarily in place for the rest of the lifetime of the affected thread of
execution. As long as $P$ is blocked, the implementation has to eventually
select and potentially strengthen a thread of execution in $S$.

Once a thread of execution in $S$ terminates, it is removed from $S$.
Once $S$ is empty, $P$ is unblocked.

\pnum
\begin{note}
A thread of execution $B$ thus can temporarily provide an effectively
stronger forward progress guarantee for a certain amount of time, due to a
second thread of execution $A$ being blocked on it with forward
progress guarantee delegation. In turn, if $B$ then blocks with
forward progress guarantee delegation on $C$, this can also temporarily
provide a stronger forward progress guarantee to $C$.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
If all threads of execution in $S$ finish executing (e.g., they terminate
and do not use blocking synchronization incorrectly), then $P$'s execution
of the operation that blocks with forward progress guarantee delegation will not
result in $P$'s progress guarantee being effectively weakened.
\end{note}

\pnum
\begin{note}
This does not remove any constraints regarding blocking synchronization for
threads of execution providing parallel or weakly parallel forward progress
guarantees because the implementation is not required to strengthen a particular
thread of execution whose too-weak progress guarantee is preventing overall progress.

is, before \tcode{A::A} is called. If, however, \tcode{a} is initialized

storage duration is sequenced before that of another, the completion of the destructor

If an object is
initialized statically, the object is destroyed in the same order as if
the object was dynamically initialized. For an object of array or class
