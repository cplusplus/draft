\chapter{Introduction}

Clauses and subclauses in this document are annotated
with a so-called stable name,
presented in square brackets next to the (sub)clause heading
(such as ``[lex.token]'' for \ref{lex.token}, ``Tokens'').
Stable names aid in the discussion and evolution of this document
by serving as stable references to subclauses across editions
that are unaffected by changes of subclause numbering.

Aspects of the language syntax of \Cpp{} are distinguished typographically
by the use of \fakegrammarterm{italic, sans-serif} type
or \tcode{constant width} type to avoid ambiguities; see \ref{syntax}.
