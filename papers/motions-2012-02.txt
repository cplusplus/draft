CWG388
======

Has a note that says:
	This resolution would require an ABI change and was thus deferred for further consideration.

No updates after that.

CWG1282
=======

Proposed resolution says:
	An implicitly declared special member function (Clause 12 [special]) 
	<del>shall have</del><ins>has</ins> an exception-specification

But text says:
	An inheriting constructor ([class.inhctor]) and an implicitly declared
	special member function...

So I used "have" instead of "has."
