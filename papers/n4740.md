## Notable editorial changes

### CWG motion 9

After consultation with CWG, the wording for injecting additional `operator<=>`
candidates has been editorially reworked, introducing a named set of "rewritten
candidates" in the place of the ad-hoc additional lookups previously specified.
That change allows the wording of this motion to be expressed more directly,
but, as a consequence, the wording changes applied for this paper differ
substantially from those moved.

### LWG motion 11

This paper introduces a large amount of new text (~78 pages), and as such a
substantial quantity of editorial changes were necessary to align the moved
wording with the Working Draft's style guidelines:

 * Reordered synopsis to match detailed description.
 * Significant changes to stable names, per style guide.
 * Added missing `zoned_traits` to `<chrono>` synopsis.
 * Removed redundant `chrono::` qualification in synopsis.
 * [time.duration.io] Significant wording changes for comprehensibility.
 * Adjusted return type of `clock_cast` in synopsis to match that in detailed description.
 * Added subheadings to clock cast description, replacing line comments in the middle of the wording.
 * Adjusted specification of `clock_cast` to avoid awkward "at least one of [...] exactly one of"
   construction and to avoid references to bullet numbers in the body text.
 * Reordered parsing and formatting sections to the end.
 * Removed descriptions for `operator!=`, `operator>`, `operator<=`, `operator>=` overloads
   that are covered by [operators]
 * Removed some tutorial front-matter and design discussion from `day`, `month`, `year`, `weekday`, etc.
 * `operator-(month, month)`, `operator-(weekday, weekday)`:
   specify returned value in *Returns:* element rather than
   splitting the specification across *Returns:* and *Remarks:*.
 * Added subheadings for the new classes to separate member and non-member function descriptions
 * Modified `time_of_day` examples to include sample code producing the given output
 * Removed exposition-only members `tzdb::next` and `tzdb_list::head_`
   that are not actually used in the exposition, after consultation with LWG.
 * Modified leap-second example to not require updates each time a leap-second is added.

### LWG motion 15

 * Rearranged sectioning to match our normal style.
 * Removed `std::` from type names in class definition.
 * Reordered member descriptions to match the style we use elsewhere.
 * Rewrote the `subspan()` wording to avoid deeply-nested expression and to
   clarify what type is denoted by the *see below* in the synopsis.

### Simplification of non-member `swap` presentation

The specification for the non-member `swap` function for container types has
been consolidated in the container requirements table, replacing the former
presentation which repeated the description once for each container.

This removes the subclauses
[deque.special],
[forwardlist.special],
[list.special],
[vector.special],
[map.special],
[multimap.special],
[set.special],
[multiset.special],
[unord.map.swap],
[unord.multimap.swap],
[unord.set.swap],
and
[unord.multiset.swap].

### `reverse_iterator` subclause consolidation

`reverse_iterator` previously had one subclause for each member function,
in violation of our normal presentation style. These subclauses have been
merged into groups of related functionality as follows:

 * [reverse.iter.op=] has been merged into [reverse.iter.cons]
 * [reverse.iter.{op==, op<, op!=, op>, op>=, op<=}] have been merged into [reverse.iter.cmp]
 * [reverse.iter.{op.star, opref, opindex}] have been merged into [reverse.iter.elem]
 * [reverse.iter.{op+, op-, op++, op+=, op--, op-=}] have been merged into [reverse.iter.nav]
 * [reverse.iter.{opdiff, opsum, make}] have been merged into [reverse.iter.nonmember]
 * [reverse.iter.ops] became empty after the above changes and has been removed.

### Simplification of `basic_regex` constant presentation

The presentation style used for the synopsis of the `basic_regex` synonyms
for the `std::regex_constants` has been shortened by use of a typedef, and
the subclause [re.regex.const] containing redundant out-of-line descriptions
of those flags has been removed.

### Cleanup of uses of the word "concept"

In the Working Draft, the word "concept" is used both in the technical sense,
denoting a C++ concept, and informally, denoting an idea or notion. We have
editorially cleaned up a few of the more confusing and ambiguous instances of
the term; most notably, Clause 6, formerly named "Basic concepts", is now
named "Basics".

## Minor editorial fixes

        [layout] Place footnotes at the bottom of the page. (#1830)
        
        This uses a feature introduced by memoir 3.7e, '\feetatbottom',
        which makes footnotes appear at the bottom of the page, rather
        than immediately following the main text.

        Explicit specialization, etc. of a concept cannot be formed
        syntactically. As such, a further rule to prevent such constructs is
        redundant as normative text.
        
        Implements the proposed direction from core/2017/07/2719.

        [views.span] Editorial review fixes:
        
          * [span.sub] Refactor the specification of subspan() slightly to define the return type precisely. Note that when Extent is not dynamic, then Extent and size() are the same, so we can say "size()" in both cases unconditionally.
        
          * Introduce new heading "Overview [span.overview]" to remove hanging paragraphs in [views.span].
        
          * Rephrase "Extent < dynamic_extent" to "Extent is negative and not equal to dynamic_extent" to avoid unnecessary dependency on details of dynamic_extent.
