## Notable editorial changes

### Motions

 * CWG 6: In application of P0298R3, updated introductory sentence of [cstddef.syn]
   to avoid claiming that `std::byte` is part of ISO C's `<stddef.h>` header.

 * CWG 9: Change to [csignal.syn] was not applied, because the desired normative
   effect had already been accomplished by [P0175R1](http://wg21.link/p0175r1),
   which was applied at the previous meeting and removed the baseline text for
   this change. The effect of the merge is that `std::signal` is *not* required
   to itself have C language linkage (but its parameter and returned function
   pointer types are). Also added subclause to house description of signal
   handlers, rather than including it in the `<csignal>` header synopsis.

 * LWG 4: The normative description of `directory_entry::is_directory` is
   specified in terms of a non-existent `file_status` member, and either the
   `status` or `symlink_status` members could have been intended. After
   [consulting with LWG](http://lists.isocpp.org/lib/2017/03/2262.php),
   this usage of `file_status` has been replaced by `status`.

### NB comments

 * `__cplusplus` macro value updated from `201402L` to `201703L`, resolving
   NB comments CA 15 and US 83.

 * Added acknowledgement of ECMAScript trademark, resolving NB comment GB 10.

 * Added normative references to LIA-1 and IEEE 754.

 * Added note to definition of literal type, resolving NB comment GB 68.

 * Made introductory sentence of [basic.stc] consistent with later normative
   wording, resolving NB comment JP 3, as directed by CWG.

### ISO Directives

 * Promoted "Scope", "Normative references", and "Terms and definitions" to
   top-level Clauses as required by ISO Directives.

 * Updated introductory text of "Normative references" and "Terms and definitions"
   to match those specified by ISO Directives.

### Content rearrangement

 * [fs.path.generic]: rearranged *pathname* grammar to avoid long paragraphs of
   text in descriptive elements and refactored to fix ambiguities in the
   grammar, after consultation with LWG.

 * [expr.prim.lambda]: split out subclauses for the closure type and captures;
   reviewed by CWG at Kona 2017.

 * Move specification of deprecated standard library headers into Annex D,
   after consultation with LWG.

### Stable name changes

 * A "Cross references from ISO C++ 2014" section has been added, listing all
   stable names from C++ 2014 that do not appear within the C++ 2017 standard,
   and where the corresponding text can be found (if it still exists).

 * Systematic review and cleanup of filesystem stable names:  
        [class.path] -> [fs.class.path]  
        [path.generic] -> [fs.path.generic]  
        [path.cvt] -> [fs.path.cvt]

    commit dbf3efe18813054c95abae388c53bf30e96e7e83
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Mon Mar 20 15:19:47 2017 -0700
    
        [intro.refs], [intro.defs] Update introductory text to match latest ISO
        Directives.
    
    commit 32825151765e214d79103a137aa29a9a4357687f
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Mon Mar 20 15:00:51 2017 -0700
    
        Replace "this International Standard" with "this document" in some
        places where it is a clear improvement.
        
        The 7th Edition of the ISO Directives no longer require us to use
        "this International Standard" when the document refers to itself. We
        retain that phrasing when the reference is to the abstract notion of
        the specification as opposed to the text embodying it.
        
        This is a step towards addressing #1389.

        [fs.path.generic] Move descriptions of grammar elements out of the
        grammar and into separate paragraphs, and format path grammar as we
        format the language grammar.
        
        Also rephrase description of root-name to use the defined term
        "implementation-defined" directly rather than separating it into
        "implementations [...] define".

        [any.modifiers] fix emplace return type for 'any' (#1545)
        
        LWG issue 2857 was applied verbatim, without noticing
        that 'ValueType' had been previously changed to 'T'.
        This makes things consistent by choosing 'T' as the
        simpler form, more consistent with 'optional' and
        'variant'.

        [unord.req] Insert hint is 'p', not 'q' (#1440)
        
        LWG 2540 changed the hint for insert from 'q'
        (a valid and dereferenceable iterator) to 'p'
        (a valid, but not necessarily dereferenceable iterator),
        but neglected to adjust the description text.
        
        Fixes #1423.
