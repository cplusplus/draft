## Notable editorial changes

### CWG motion 1

The edits for CWG2310 inadvertently required the base class to be complete
instead of the derived class in one of the edits. After consultation with CWG,
the derived class is now required to be complete in all cases.

The edits for CWG2331 were intended to be an editorial cleanup and wording
simplification, but were found to have unintentional normative effect. This
issue is being returned to CWG for redrafting.

The edits for CWG2332 added a note that was not entirely accurate. The note,
along with the normative text that it references, have been rephrased to
clarify that an injected-class-name is never interpreted as a *template-name*
in a context in which class template argument deduction would apply (even
though it can be interpreted as a *template-name* in some cases in a context
where a *decl-specifier* might be parsed, such as in a *template-argument*).

### CWG motion 2

The wording moved for CWG2020 inadvertently omitted some edits that were part
of the wording reviewed by CWG. Those edits were not substantive, and have been
restored editorially.

### CWG motion 12

Removed redundant restatement of the `operator==` symmetry rule in defaulted
`operator!=`; looking for reversed candidates and rewriting `==` expressions is
already handled by overload resolution, and a reversed `operator==` can never
be selected anyway because the two arguments are of the same type.

Likewise the corresponding redundant wording was removed from the rules for
defaulted operators `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` that inaccurately claimed they
could select a reversed `operator<=>`.

### CWG motion 15

Modernized the wording to follow current editorial conventions, and simplified
where possible.

Fixed a contradiction between the core and library wording; the library wording
allowed a `coroutine_handle<>` to resume any coroutine, but the core wording
did not account for that possibility and only permitted resumption via a
`coroutine_handle<P>` with the right promise type `P`.

### LWG motion 2

Replaced the references to *CopyConstructible* and *CopyAssignable* with the
intended *Cpp17CopyConstructible* and *Cpp17CopyAssignable* after consultation
with LWG.

### Section label changes

Several section labels introduced by the motions papers have been modified
to match our style guide. In addition to the section labels affected by the
above motions, all section labels containing underscores have been renamed
to instead use periods.

### Reversion of prior editorial change

In N4791 (the post-San-Diego working draft), an editorial change was applied
to repair missing wording in 2018-11 CWG motion 14
([P0595R2 "`std::is_constant_evaluated()`"](http://wg21.link/p0595r2)).
This change added a definition of the term "usable in constant expressions"
as applied to objects and references that was inadvertently dropped from the
wording during CWG review.

Further review within CWG has shown that the dropped wording is also incorrect,
so the editorial fix has been reverted (leaving the definition absent rather
than incorrect), and a proper definition will be inserted by a core issue.

## Minor editorial fixes

A log of editorial fixes made to the working draft since N4800 is below.
This list excludes changes
that do not affect the body text or only affect whitespace or typeface. For a
complete list including such changes (or for the actual deltas applied by these
changes), consult the [draft sources on github](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/compare/n4800...n4810).

        [decl.init]/10 Fix specified initialization.
        
        According to [basic.start.static]/2, for objects with static storage duration,
        zero initialization performs only if constant initialization does not.
        [decl.init]/10 can be generalized to static initialization.
        This is an editorial note change.

        Revert "[expr.const] Add missing definition of 'usable in constant expressions'"
        
        The prior editorial fix was an attempt to re-add wording that was
        missing from P0595R2 (moved as 2018-11 CWG Motion 14). However, CWG
        analysis has indicated that the editorial fix is incomplete, so we're
        reverting it to restore the wording to the as-moved state.
        
        This reverts commit e58439bce8af85e6569328272c2cfb73f5fc44d6.

        await-suspend is called.
        
        Fix wording that uses values and objects on the left-hand side of a
        class member access to instead consistently use expressions.

        A type can't be the current instantiation either, but that's a

           different D than the one already in scope
