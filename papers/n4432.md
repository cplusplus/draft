## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Jonathan Wakely for providing many editorial fixes.

Thanks to all those who have [submitted editorial
issues](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/wiki/How-to-submit-an-editorial-issue)
and those who have provided pull requests with fixes.

## New Papers

 * N4431 is the current working draft. It replaces N4296.
 * N4432 is this Editor's Report for the current working draft.

### Notable Changes to Issues and Papers as Moved

No motions have been voted into the working draft since N4296.

### Other Notable Editorial Changes:

2013-04 CWG motion 4 moved that the proposed resolution of CWG1531 be adopted.
However, due to an oversight, the motion stated that the resolution be taken
from N3539 (which contains no wording for this issue) instead of the intended
N3674. As a result, no modification was made to the standard for this issue.
As the changes are editorial in nature, and the intent of the committee is
clear, this Working Draft incorporates the changes for CWG1531 specified in
N3674.

A bug has been fixed that resulted in cross-references to definitions
(in [intro.defs] and [definitions]) missing the final number from their
section.

## Minor Editorial Fixes

A log of all editorial fixes made since N4296 is below:

    commit 47bd8e96cf0528cab40c467cf65da25e7bd70bf5
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Thu Apr 9 13:23:27 2015 -0700
    
        Add back redundant 'of arithmetic type' requirement at request of lib-37799.
    
    commit 8866e4d6d43bc4b7456852e64a2838681a9c77d3
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Wed Apr 8 19:13:26 2015 -0700
    
        CWG1531 Definition of "access" (verb)
        
        This was supposed to be moved by 201304 CWG motion 4, but that motion
        referred to N3539, which did not have wording for this issue, so it
        was technically never moved. However, the clear intent of the committee
        was to move this resolution and the resolution is editorial in nature.
        
        Fixes #464.

        [basic.stc.auto] Fix apparent contradiction: the `static` implied by
        `thread_local` is not explicit, so this wording could be read as

        duration, contradicting wording in several other parts of the standard
        and the design intent.
