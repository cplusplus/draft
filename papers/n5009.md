## Acknowledgements

Thanks to all those who have
[submitted editorial issues](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/wiki/How-to-submit-an-editorial-issue),
to those who have provided pull requests with fixes,
and to everyone who drafted motion applications.

## New papers

 * [N5008](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/n5008.pdf) is the
   current working draft for C++26. It replaces
   [N5001](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/n5001.pdf).
 * N5009 is this Editors' Report.

## Motions incorporated into working draft

### Notes on motions

LWG Poll 2 was retracted.

Library issue [LWG4189](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3615r0.html#4189),
adopted by LWG Poll 1 (P3615R0) had the effect of making most of the content of `<ranges>`
free-standing by default, with the note that "[m]ost future additions to this header should
have no problem being freestanding, so that is the right default." Absent an explicit
opt-out, the new facilities from LWG Poll 14
([P2846R6](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p2846r6.html)),
`reserve_hint` and `approximately_sized_range`, are now free-standing as well.

        To the existing Note at the beginning of [simd.general],

        Add bibliography entry for Flynn 1966, the paper that introduced what
        later became known as "Flynn's Taxonomy."  This classifies parallel
        computer hardware as SISD, SIMD, MISD, or MIMD.

        [lex.phases] Update implementation defined text

        Since C++23 we no longer have physical source files, but rather
        input files.  Update the two implementation-defined references
        to the mapping from input file to translation character set
        using the same phrasing so that they provide the same entry
        in the index of implementation-defined behavior, just as they
        did in C++20, before getting out of sync when the terminology
        changed.

        [std] Use template-parameter and template parameter more consistently (#7460)

        Try to use template-parameter only when we refer to a
        grammar construct, and to 'template parameter' everywhere else.

        Adopt the same logic to template-argument/template argument.

        This change might not be  exhaustive.

        The aim is to editorially adopt some of the wording changes
        made in P2841R5 to ease its review in core.

        [macros] Add LaTeX macros to index library macros

        The immediate idea is to support using the new macros directly
        in header synopses when defining each library macro.  This will
        ensure that no macros are accidentally not indexed.

        A follow-up plan is that this separation of library macros will
        make it easier to create a separate index of macros, or apply
        other macro-specific renderings, in the future.  To this end,
        all indexed uses of a macro, not just those in header files,
        should be replaced by use of these new macros.  Similarly,
        these LaTeX macros can be used in-place in regular text to
        index cross-references where standard library macros are used
        throughout the standard.

        [cmath.syn] Consolidate std namespaces

        There is no ordering dependency between the two typedefs
        in namespace std, the macros that follow, and teh next
        opening of namespace std, so move the two typedefs to
        avoid repeatedly opening an closing the namespace.

        Note that we could have done this without moving
        the typedefs as macros are not bound by namespaces,
        but our convention very sensibly avoids confusing
        readers by keeping macro definitions outside of
        namespaces.

        [except.uncaught] Tidy the specification for uncaught exceptions

        Several concurrent fixes.  First include the normative wording
        that 'uncaught_exceptions' returns the number of uncaught
        exceptions *on the current thread*.  This wording is present
        in the core language.

        Then move the core wording for when an exception is uncaught
        directly into the text that talks about caught and uncaught
        exceptions.  In the process, turn the reference to into a note,
        so that there is only one normative specification.

        Finally, remove [except.uncaught] as it is now empty.

        [basic.pre] Defragment specification of names and entities

        The current contents of [basic.pre] jump between specifying
        different things.  This PR moves all the specification of
        names to the front, followed by the specification of entities.

        There are two main benefits: (1) the specification for when
        two names are the same is a list of 4 rules that correspond
        to the 4 things than can form a name --- the connection is
        much clearer when the paragraphs are adjacent and the list
        is sorted to the same order; (2) in this form, even though
        all the words are the same, the reordering and merging of
        paragraphs a fit on a single page.  The very last paragraph
        was forced over a page-break in the original layout.

        [debugging.utility] Clarify wording in notes

        The previous wording in the notes in `breakpoint` and `is_debugger_present`
        read as statements of fact about the implementation-defined behaviour.
        The statements are actually ones of intent.

        The specific claim in `breakpoint` that the debugger resumes execution of the program
        as if the function was not invoked is confusing considering that the debugger may effect
        side-effects or cause execution to resume from a different evaluation.

        Instead, the idea is that `breakpoint` is not responsible for causing the translation process
        to make special accomodations for resumption of execution other than in cases
        where the debugger was strictly used for observation only.

        In `is_debugger_present`, the functionality ascribed to POSIX by the wording
        ("ptrace") is not present in POSIX. Update to reference the LSB and to use
        the corresponding terminology ("tracing process").

        The wording implies a preference to return `true` in case it is unknown
        whether a debugger is present. Add a critical "only" to fix that.
