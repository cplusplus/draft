## Notable editorial changes

### CWG motion 8

Instead of removing [operators] and adding a new section to [requirements], the
existing stable name for this section is preserved. This section was moved to
[description] rather than to [requirements], as it describes a notational
device used for standard exposition.

[alg.3way] added to [alg.sorting] rather than [alg.nonmodifying] to
match existing `lexicographical_compare` functions.

### LWG motion 8

`[[nodiscard]]` was inadvertantly omitted from `deque::empty()` in the detailed
wording changes (but was covered by the general description of the change).
After consultation with LWG, this oversight has been corrected in the wording.

### LWG motion 10

All references to the existing `memory_order_*` enumerators throughout the
working draft were updated to use the new scoped enumerator nmaes.

### LWG motion 11

Changes were made to the organization and presentation of the wording
to fit better into the existing document.

### LWG motion 12

The requested addition to [pointer.traits.function] has been moved into a new
subclause "Pointer traits optional members" and modified slightly to fit this
new presentation, as it does not describe a member of the `pointer_traits`
primary template.

### Text reorganization

In an effort to conform to ISO drafting directives to avoid hanging paragraphs
(text in subclauses that also contain further nested subclauses) and to remove
excessive subclause structure, the following changes have been made:

* [intro] and [basic] have been reorganized so that [intro] acts as an
  introduction to the standard document and [basic] introduces the basic
  concepts of the standard in an order closer to dependency order
* [conv.rank] moved from [conv] to [basic.types], as it does not describe a conversion.
* [expr] has additional subclause structure to partially resolve hanging
  paragraphs and generally improve its organization
* [expr] has a new subclause describing properties of expressions, containing
  some of the prior hanging paragraphs from [expr], as well as [basic.lval]
* [array], [util.sharedptr] Per-function subclauses have been merged into parent subclause.

### Changes in the style of specification

* Code font is no longer used when referring to non-syntax properties of entities
  (even when those properties are derived from syntax). This applies to the terms
  "inline", "friend", "public", "protected", "private", "const object".
  We generally intend to use code font only when referring specifically
  to program syntax.

* In library wording, template headers are formatted consistently with no
  space between the `template` keyword and the `<` token.

Drafting for future standard changes should take the above into account.

### Index of library headers

In order to keep the "Index of library names" focused on listing library names,
index entries for library headers have been moved to a separate, new "Index of
library headers".

        Consistent comma after e.g. and i.e.
        
        After grepping to determine the preferred idiom, it seems clear that
        the standard prefers to follow both e.g. and i.e. with a comma, rather
        than omit it.  This patch applies that rule to the few places that
        were missing the comma.
