## Notable changes to papers as moved

### CWG motion 3

The note added as part of the resolution of NB GB 079 was reworded editorially,
as described below in the list of editorial NB comment resolutions.

### CWG motion 8

The following feature test macro changes were made for this paper,
after consultation with SG10:

The feature test macro `__cpp_nontype_template_parameter_class` has been removed
to indicate that the feature added by [P0732R2](http://wg21.link/p0732r2)
is no longer present in the same form.

The value of the feature test macro `__cpp_nontype_template_args` has been increased
to `201911L` to indicate support for [P1907R1](http://wg21.link/p1907r1).

### LWG motion 11

The description of this paper specifies that:

> each such `base()` member [of a range adaptor, that returns a copy of the underlying view]
> be replaced to by two overloads:
> a `const`-qualified overload that requires the type of the underlying view to model CopyConstructible, and
> a `&&`-qualified overload that extracts the underlying view from the adaptor

but the wording changes omitted explicit editing instructions
to make these changes to the
`take_while_view`, `drop_view`, `drop_while_view` and `elements_view`
range adaptors, which were added by [P1035R7](http://wg21.link/p1035r7)
(2019-07 LWG Motion 23), after R0 of this paper was authored.

Consistent with the proposal in the paper,
and after consulting the paper authors and the LWG chair,
the corresponding changes were also applied to
the additional range adaptors listed above.

### LWG motion 16

This paper removed the exposition-only concept *`range-impl`*,
inlining it into its only remaining user, the `range` concept.
However, two uses of *`range-impl`* were left behind.
These have been updated and suitably adjusted
to refer to `range` instead.

LWG motion 13 ([P1394R4](http://wg21.link/p1394r4))
added a couple of new uses of
the exposition-only concept *`forwarding-range`*,
which was removed by this paper.
These uses have been replaced with `safe_range`.

### LWG motion 19

Did not add the macro `__cpp_lib_atomic_ref`.
This macro already existed with the specified value.

Did not change the value of the `__cpp_lib_chrono` macro.
The requested new value of this macro (`201803L`)
is actually lower than the current value
(`201907L`, not `201611L` as listed in [P1902R1](http://wg21.link/p1902r1)).
The chair of SG10 has confirmed that the request to change this macro's value
is an error. The pre-existing, higher value is retained.

Did not change the value of the `__cpp_lib_ranges` macro.
The requested new value of this macro (`201907L`)
is lower than the value `201911L` introduced by
[P1716R3](http://wg21.link/po1716r3) (LWG motion 6).

## Disposition of editorial NB comments on C++ 2020 CD1

Listed below are draft disposition for all comments that were
filed as editorial in the ISO 14882 CD (2019) NB comments.
Except where otherwise noted, these dispositions only represent the current
viewpoint of the Project Editor.

US 021: Accepted, fixed in 50e55ce9.

 * Split index entries to "block (execution)" and "block (statement)".
 * Also added the statement form to Clause 3, Terms and Definitions.

GB 022: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 8cc6bd34.

 * The relevant change had already been made to [using.headers],
   but this corresponding change was missed.

 * **Modified resolution:**
   Added a cross-reference to [using.headers] instead of
   the suggested cross-reference to [headers].

JP 023: Accepted, fixed in 868934f7.

JP 030: No consensus for change.

 * The text immediately following the grammar makes it clear that
   both lowercase `p` and uppercase `P` are permitted.

US 031: No consensus for change.

 * The example appears to be valid as-is;
   adding `!= 0` does not appear to serve any purpose.

GB 032: Accepted, fixed in 84a1cd53.

US 037: No consensus for change.

 * The proposed change is not editorial.
   Forwarded to SG2 for consideration and rejected.

FR 039: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 68a6dfef.

 * **Filed as technical**; SG2 concluded the wording is confusing,
   already does what the comment requests
   (except that ADL also finds friend declarations in a class
   in the same conditions under which
   member lookup would find member declarations in the class).
   Recategorized as editorial to clarify the wording.

 * **Modified resolution:**
   Definition of "interface" (of a module) inlined into its only use (and removed),
   making it clear that [basic.lookup.argdep]/4.4 only finds exported declarations.

JP 045: Accepted, fixed in d401794f.

 * This fixes a misapplication of the resolution of CWG 2381.

US 047: Accepted with modifications, fixed in 785f689d.

 * **Modified resolution:**
  Instead of removing the redundant sentence, it was converted into a note
  and moved after the following sentence of which it is a consequence.

US 052: Accepted, fixed by [P1971R0](http://wg21.link/p1971r0) (CWG motion 3).

 * The proposed change is not editorial.
   Forwarded to CWG for consideration and accepted.

JP 057: Accepted, fixed in a06b7a49.

GB 078: Accepted, fixed in e3bb2eba.

 * Italicized references to *digit*s that intended to refer to the grammar production.
 * Also made some nearby editorial improvements:
   added cross-references and fixed an adjacent grammar issue ("is" / "are") in [diff.cpp14.library].

GB 079: Accepted, fixed by [P1971R0](http://wg21.link/p1971r0) (CWG motion 3).

 * Forwarded to SG2 for consideration. Accepted and example added by CWG.
 * Added note prior to example editorially revised after consultation with CWG.

US 085: No consensus for change.

 * Per the description in [module.import],
   translation units are imported, modules are not.
   The wording appears to be correct as-is.

US 088: Accepted with modifications, fixed in d382ea4e.

 * **Modified resolution:**
  Instead of either of the proposed renamings,
  renamed [module.global] to [module.global.frag] and
  renamed [cpp.glob.frag] to [cpp.global.frag].

GB 089: Accepted, fixed in fa42d5a6.

US 099: Accepted, fixed in 9b0502bf.

   does not prevent a translation unit including both.
 * An LWG issue will be opened to consider
   whether we should require more of the iostreams headers to include `<iosfwd>`;

### Late comments

CH 02: Accepted, fixed in 5ee93fd7.

## Notable editorial changes

### Typeface

The typeface used for grammar productions has been changed
from italic to a slanted sans-serif font
in order to distinguish grammar productions
from defined terms.
Many other options have been considered,
but this option provided the most visually appealing outcome.

Please inform the editors if you discover
any places where the wrong typeface is used
for a grammar production or other italicized term.

### Section moves

Moved [temp.deduct.guide] under [temp.class],
alongside the description of members of class templates.

Moved [range.istream] under [range.factories].
`basic_istream_view` is a range factory not a range adaptor.

### Section label changes

 * [module.global] -> [module.global.frag]
 * [cpp.glob.frag] -> [cpp.global.frag]

        [dcl.type.elab] Clarify that there is no expected correlation between
        using 'class' or 'struct' in a class definition and using the same
        keyword in an elaborated-type-specifier.

        [lib] Replace "shall not X" with "does not X" when it describes library behavior.
        
        In these places we aren't saying "it's UB if X happens"; we're literally
        specifying the behavior of a library function as "X does not happen,
        we promise."
        
        Jonathan Wakely points out that there is still room for the user to cause UB
        by specializing `pair`, `duration`, `function`, etc. such that their specializations
        do X. In that case, the UB happens due to [namespace.std] p2, which requires
        that "the [program-defined] specialization meets the standard library requirements
        for the original template."

        [lex.charset] Fix various issues with the description of UCNs.
        
        Clarify that \U sequences not beginning 00 are ill-formed. Clarify
        handling of code points naming reserved or noncharacter code points.
        Remove unnecessary circumlocution through "short identifiers" by
        directly talking about code points. Use code point values directly
        rather than using C++ 0x notation.
        
        [lex.string] Fix description of what UCNs mean, and convert it to a
        note.
