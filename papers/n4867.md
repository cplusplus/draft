## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to
Eelis van der Weegen and
Krystian Stasiowski
for providing numerous editorial fixes, and to
Jonathan Wakely
for checking the correctness of
several editorial changes to the library specification.

Thanks to all those who have [submitted editorial
issues](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/wiki/How-to-submit-an-editorial-issue)
and to those who have provided pull requests with fixes.

## New papers

 * [N4868](http://wg21.link/n4868) is the current working draft for C++23. It
   replaces [N4861](http://wg21.link/n4861).
 * N4867 is this Editors' Report.

In addition, NB and ISO/CS comments provided on ISO/IEC DIS 14882:2020(E) have
been addressed and an editorially revised final C++20 standard has been
transmitted to ISO for publication. The below text indicates which changes were
applied to both the C++20 IS and which were applied only to the C++23 working
draft.

## Motions incorporated into working draft

This revision contains only editorial changes relative to N4861.

## Notable editorial changes to C++20 and the working draft

The changes listed below were mostly driven by comments received on the C++20
DIS, and were applied to both the C++20 IS and the current working draft.

### Clause 2: Normative References

At the request of ISO/CS, we have ensured that all documents listed in Clause 2
are normatively referenced by the body text, and moved the remaining instances
to the Bibliography.

Subclause [fs.norm.ref], the "Normative References" subclause for the
filesystem portion of the library, was merged into Clause 2 and dissolved.

### Clause 3: Terms and Definitions

At the request of ISO/CS, the standard library "Terms and definitions"
subclause has been merged into Clause 3.

### Hanging paragraphs

At the request of ISO/CS, each section contains either two or more subclauses
or some body text, never a combination of both. To support this, a few
single-item subclauses were dissolved, and many "General" subclauses were added
to contain the body text in sections that contain both subclauses and body
text.

### Notes and examples

At the request of ISO/CS, each note and example is now separated from
surrounding text by line breaks, and notes and examples are rendered one point
smaller than the font size of the body text.

### Modal verbs

At the request of ISO/CS, we have fixed a number of occurrences of
inappropriate use of the modal verbs "shall", "may", "can", "must", "should",
"might", and "could" and implemented automated checking to ensure that the
normative verbs "shall", "should", and "may" do not appear in non-normative
contexts.

The fixes included changing the verb in use, rephrasing, and in some cases
converting notes that contained normative requirements or normative
encouragement into non-note body text.

### Misapplied motions

We found a small number of cases where a motion for C++20 had not been fully
applied and fixed them.

## Notable editorial changes to the working draft only

### Terms and definitions

The subclause [re.def], which is another "Terms and definitions" subclause, has
been merged into Clause 3. Unfortunately, this additional subclause was not
noticed in time to be fixed for the C++20 IS.

## Minor editorial fixes

A log of editorial fixes made to the working draft since N4861 is below.
This list excludes changes
that do not affect the body text or only affect whitespace or typeface. For a
complete list including such changes (or for the actual deltas applied by these
changes), consult the [draft sources on github](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/compare/n4861...n4868).

        Replace "this subclause" with an explicit reference in all
        formerly-hanging paragraphs.
        
        These typically mean the parent subclause now. Mechanically:
        
        "this subclause" became "\ref{parent}".
        
        "This subclause" became "Subclause \ref{parent}", because it doesn't
        look great to start a sentennce with a subclause number.
        
        ... with some manual fixups for cases where that didn't work out well.

        Fix solitary subclauses.
        
        ISO rules don't permit us to have a subclause with no siblings. We had
        six of these, for various reasons. Fold them together or add more
        subclauses to un-isolate.
        
        For ISO/CS 018 (C++20 DIS).

        ISO documents.

        [module.reach] Clarify that only TUs with an interface dependency may be incidentally reachable
        
        I think this is the intent of that sentence. Another possible reading, and the one my rewording attempts to prevent, is that because it doesn't say that no other TUs may be reachable, any TU may be, and it is just giving an example of a specific likely case of incidental reachability. But if that is the intent, then we probably shouldn't have it in normative text.
        
        There is an existing issue in the wording in that http://eel.is/c++draft/module#import-10 defines "has an interface dependency" as a relationship between two TUs, but this uses it as a relationship between "point with the program" and a TU. This makes it ambiguous about whether TU imported later in a file may be reachable at an earlier point. I am not trying to resolve that ambiguity with this change.
