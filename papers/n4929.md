## Motions incorporated into working draft

### Notes

 * CWG issue 2602 was withdrawn from the motions. Even though it is part of
   [P2709R0](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2709r0.html),
   it has not been applied.
 * CWG issue 2642 (in
   [P2710R0](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2710r0.html#2642),
   polled in CWG poll 3) was discovered to be incorrect after the WG21 meeting;
   CWG has requested that the issue not be applied and reverted to the working
   group for further discussion. It has not been applied.

### Noteworthy editorial changes

* There were no noteworthy changes to the wording of the approved papers.
* A new subclause "Arithmetic types" was added. The new subclause contains
  both "integer types" (`<cstdint>`) and the new "extended floating-point
  types" (`<stdfloat>`). Previously, the newly added `<stdfloat>` synopsis
  was somewhat disconnected and out of context.

        [basic.life] Change "complete const object" to "const, complete object" (#5818)

        "Complete object" is a defined term (https://eel.is/c++draft/basic#def:complete_object).
        Putting "const" in the middle of that leaves it ambiguous whether we are referring to
        a const-qualified "complete object", or to a complete const object with some other meaning
        of "complete" (such as "with a complete type").

        The new subclause contains both "integer types" (<cstdint>)
        and "extended floating-point types" (<stdfloat>).

        Previously, the newly added <stdfloat> synopsis was somewhat
        disconnected and out of context.

        This change removes the stable labels [cstdint] and [cstdint.general].

        [utility.arg.requirements] Present identifiers as itemization (#5856)

        Lists providing the key for names used throughout a subclause are difficult
        to follow when buried as a single sentence in a paragraph. This change updates
        the key to tables 29-36 in [utility.arg.requirements] to a bulleted list
        following the examples set elsewhere.

        Each key is now consistently introduced with the word "denotes", following
        the precedent set by similar bullet lists.

        It is not at all coincidental that this also resolves pagination issues
        at the end of the page, so that the floating tables to not float into the
        middle of a sentence in the following section.

        [views] Subclauses for contiguous and multidimensional access

        This organises the material for <span> and <mdspan> into separate
        subclauses, rather than having all constituent parts being siblings in
        the same subclause. Even though we now have some subclauses six levels
        deep, this seems like an improvement. As a drive-by, this allows us to
        move a subclause on a non-member span helper function up one level,
        where it is more appropriate.

        [func.wrap.move.ctor] Move private expos member to general index

        The private, exposition-only data member is not useful in the library
        index. However, there seems no reason to not show it in the general
        index, so we move the index entry from the library index to the
        general index.

        Partially fixes NB GB 137 (C++23 CD).

        [coro.generator.promise] Use "equivalent to `throw`, ..."

        Our style guide says that "equivalent to <expression>" is the
        appropriate style for an expression of type `void`, which is the case
        for `throw`. This avoids the awkward situation of having "equivalent
        to: `throws;`" appear in the middle of a paragraph without proper
        terminal punctuation.

        Fixes NB US 119 (C++23 CD).

        [expr.unary.op] Say "the ~ operator" consistently, remove "unary"

        We are currently using the term "unary complement operator" to refer
        to the "~" operator without ever giving it that name. This change
        removes the use of that undefined term.

        [depr.conversions.string] remove redundent respecification (#6004)

        There are several typedef names defined precisely in the deprecated code conversion
        facets classes that are redundantly respecified in text. Nowhere else in the library
        does this; any specified typedef names are _see below_ definitions, not repeats of
        the class definition. Needless redundancy is always a risk of divergence, however
        small, so remove the respecification in text form.

        Some of the template parameters of `yield_value` were inconsistent,
        and the synopsis contained an outright typo. This change uses `R2`
        consistently since the parameter is a reference.

        previously been cleaned up similarly.
