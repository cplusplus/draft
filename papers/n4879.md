## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to Casey Carter, Davis Herring, and Jonathan Wakely
for checking the correctness of several editorial changes.

Thanks to all those who have [submitted editorial
issues](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/wiki/How-to-submit-an-editorial-issue)
and to those who have provided pull requests with fixes.

## New papers

 * [N4878](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/n4878.pdf) is the
   current working draft for C++23. It replaces
   [N4868](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/n4868.pdf).
 * N4879 is this Editors' Report.

## Wide-ranging editorial changes to modal verbs

Recall that during the DIS review for C++20, ISO had already requested that we
fix inappropriate use of the modal verbs "shall", "may", "can", "must",
"should", "might", and "could", according to the ISO drafting directives. Many of
those changes had been made for the C++20 document and had also been applied to
the C++23 working draft.

However, during the final stages of publication of C++20, ISO pointed out
further inappropriate uses of specifically "could" and "might". Previously we
had removed those verbs from normative text, but ISO clarified that they also
must not appear in notes. We have reviewed the use of these modal verbs
comprehensively and applied editorial changes wherever we found them to improve
the overall quality of the text:

* [Replace "could" and "might", Clauses 1-15](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/431818492f83ca3c3a188906ad562ec24d9aa664)
* [Replace "could" and "might", Clauses 16-32](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/b2df3252873f18f272fcc6e72649312a19c8b5ad)
* [Replace "could" and "might" in Annexes](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/commit/6bf61cfdabec7b1c7c0076c9aacc1ebcabd02b05)

Many further occurrences of "could" and "might" remain in the text, where we did
not see an obvious solution. We plan on describing ISO's policy in a separate
paper, for the attention of the committee, so as to help future papers to avoid
the banned constructions. We also plan to liaise with the wording groups, either
informally or via papers, to resolve the remaining occurrences.

## Editorial fixes

### Changes to motions

* **Poll CWG-5, P1787R6:** This large paper conflicted with polls CWG-1 and
  CWG-3, and also with the aforementioned modal verb changes.
  - The conflict with CWG-1 had a clear resolution.
  - The conflict with CWG-3 resulted in a small set of follow-up changes
    proposed by the paper author and reviewed by CWG.
  - [dcl.pre] Turn 'must' into a note.
  - [dcl.link] Clarify sentence structure.
  - [dcl.type.elab] Clarify 'declaration'.
  - [dcl.spec.auto.general] Clarify redeclarations vs. placeholder types.
  - [dcl.meaning.general] Clarify origin of 'declarator-id'.
* **LWG2820:** The formatting of "see below" and "optional" were changed for consistency.
* **LWG3448:** The issue resolution introduced the exposition-only template
  *`maybe-const`*. Subsequently, all uses of `using Base = conditional_t<Const,
  const V, V>;` have been replaced by <code>using Base = <em>maybe-const</em>&lt;Const, V&gt;;</code>
  throughout the document.
* **LWG3460:** The phrase "returns the same value" was clarified to "returns the
  same non-null value" on suggestion of and with review by LWG members.
* **LWG3472:** The words "is `true`" were added to expressions in preconditions,
  according to our conventions.
* **Poll LWG-5, P0881R7:**
  - Removed [stacktrace.def] subheading to avoid confusion with "Terms and Definitions" clause.
  - Turned a note with "should" into "Recommended practice".
  - Added some missing articles.
  - Appended "is `true`" to expressions in preconditions.
* **Poll LWG-8, P0943R6:**
  - The stable label was renamed to [stdatomic.h.syn] according to our convention.
  - A missing entry in the Clause's summary table was added.
  - References to the (absence of) the header "stdatomic.h" elsewhere in the
    document have been updated.

        [util.smartptr.weak] Remove redundant declaration of 'swap' (#4037)
        
        The declaration of the non-member function is already present in the header synopsis [memory.syn] and does not need to be repeated in the class synopsis. We generally don't do this for any other free 'swap' function, either.

         [time.clock.gps.members] Fix misspelled return type. (#4318)
        
        The returns specification for `gps_clock::to_utc` says `gps_time` instead of `utc_time`, probably a copy-paste typo from p3. The original proposal, P0355R7, also says `gps_time`, but the intent seems obvious, and the status quo doesn't compile.

        [expr.sub] Make deprecation of commas in brackets normative.
        
        Core language deprecations are stated in core wording, and then
        cross-referenced from Annex D. All current references to deprecating
        this feature are notes, hence there is no normative deprecation.
        
        This change promotes a note to non-note, normative text.

        The latter name is used everywhere else, the former was only used in

        are already present in the header synopsis [functional.syn] and do not
        need to be repeated in the class synopsis.
