### Notable changes to papers as moved

#### CWG motion 4

Wording and paragraph ordering within [new.delete] was modified
to be consistent across all of the largely-duplicated subsections.

#### CWG motions 5 and 6

Some clause labels were renamed from those proposed by these papers, for
consistency with the rest of the standard, as follows:

 * [dcl.auto.deduct] -> [dcl.type.auto.deduct]
 * [deduced.class.type] -> [dcl.type.class.deduct]
 * [class.template.deduction] -> [over.match.class.deduct]
 * [temp.deduction.guide] -> [temp.deduct.guide]

#### CWG motion 15

Added missing edit to clause 12 to avoid conflict with wording added to clause
3, which makes a `static inline` data member declaration a definition. The
clause 12 wording had text left over from `constexpr` rules that required an
initializer to be provided.

#### LWG motion 2, issue 2683

Proposed wording did not fit surrounding text and has been reworded.

#### LWG motion 7

This paper did not update the definition of "C standard" in
[intro.scope]/2 from C99 to C11. This change has also not been
made editorially, as it is unclear whether this omission is
intentional or an oversight. The paper has been applied as written,
but this issue warrants further investigation.

#### LWG motion 8

The purpose of this paper was to request editorial freedom to restructure the
description of the parts of the C++ standard library that were inherited from
C. To this end, the edits applied are based on those in P0175R1, but in
addition, the descriptions of many C library functions have been moved,
reordered, and reformatted into the standard format used for C++ library
description.

See the list of editorial fixes below for the full details.

#### LWG motion 12

Added missing updates to definition of class template `optional` to match
changes in detailed description.

Removed detailed description of variant's `in_place_type` and `in_place_index`
to match changes to synopsis.

The template parameters to `in_place_index_t` and the corresponding form of
`in_place` were specified as `template<int>` and `template<size>` respectively
in the wording paper, and have been editorially corrected to the intended
`template<size_t>`.

#### LWG motion 13

Proposed wording has different signatures for `from_chars` in the synopsis and
in the detailed wording. **The paper was returned to LWG for redrafting, and
a revised wording paper has been provided by the paper author as
[P0067R4](http://wg21.link/p0067r4).**

#### LWG motion 21

No explicit editing instructions were provided to merge this motion with
the introduction of `std::pmr` from 2016-02 LWG Motion 6,
which the base document for this motion predates.
At the request of the paper author,
and based on the clear intent of both motions,
the change was also applied to the containers in namespace `std::pmr`.

### Notable editorial changes since N4594

 * As noted in LWG motion 8, descriptions of subclauses related to the portions
   of the C standard library incorporated into C++ have been substantially
   reorganized.

 * The index of clause labels (formerly known as Annex F) has been demoted from
   an Annex to a regular index and now lists the page number in addition to the
   section number for each clause.

## Minor editorial fixes

A log of all editorial fixes made since N4594 is below:

    commit 0f682fdcccd2c3a64d478e1e3cdcf3d8f6928bd1
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Mon Jul 11 18:11:57 2016 -0700
    
        Fix review comments from Jeffrey.
        
        [any.modifiers] The Requires: clause here was redundant, since the
        Remarks: clause gives the same condition as a SFINAE condition.
        
        [path.itr] Align the phrasing of the way in which path::iterator is not
        a bidirectional iterator with the corresponding phrasing in the
        description of the bidirectional iterator requirements.
    
    commit 8f0c572eae9b8306e5d78a86dbdebf5c353f5895
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Mon Jul 11 14:38:33 2016 -0700
    
        [meta.type.synop] Italicize placeholder text "default-alignment" to
        match formatting in detailed description.
    
    commit bd00cfb2b9f505220b6fc92f0310e56e11209e67

    Author: burblebee <dawn+github@burble.org>
    Date:   Mon Jul 11 12:35:21 2016 -0700
    
        Make universal-character-name \grammarterm'd (#807)
        
        Fixes #296
    
    commit 6098c7fa264ac862711616ca933611220e6cc208
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Sun Jul 10 23:55:31 2016 -0700
    
        [c.math] Change title of this subclause from "C library" to
        "Mathematical functions for floating point types" to match its contents;
        the special math functions in <cmath> are not part of the C library.
    
    commit b882709b88e8d8f88b47036f75d99e6949e470fd
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Sun Jul 10 17:46:47 2016 -0700
    
        [objects.within.classes] Clarify what "exposition only" means for
        private members that are not data members. This applies the first
        portion of LWG2516 (voted into Lib Fundamentals) to the working paper.
    
    commit 9c4447539b309db428186ecdfc47809d3ace96fc
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Sun Jul 10 17:15:49 2016 -0700
    
        Rename [util.smartptr.weakptr] to [util.smartptr.weak.bad]. This section
        describes the bad_weak_ptr exception class, so the previous name was
        completely inappropriate.
        
        Fixes #801.
    
    commit 5f9e2c145d98a7cc605993359d2e2a5437d083a5
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Sun Jul 10 17:03:29 2016 -0700
    
        [fs.op.relative] Replace "Returns A except B if an error is produced"
        with "Returns A, or B if an error is produced" to match similar wording
        elsewhere.
    
    commit 73b8f1ab222076c4b02be47c1b7e1386247695a9
    Author: Richard Smith <richard@metafoo.co.uk>
    Date:   Sun Jul 10 16:59:29 2016 -0700
    
        [any] Fix template parameter list of make_any to list the
        parameter that is intended to be explicitly specified first. The
        wording paper had inconsistent parameter orders between the synopsis and
        the detailed wording, and this is the obvious intent.
        
        Fixes #813.
    
    commit 186885a158863e204b45251ecced3c6938dd3c6d
    Author: timsong-cpp <rs2740@gmail.com>
    Date:   Sun Jul 10 14:42:39 2016 -0400
    
        [func.default.traits] Remove inappropriate reference to [unord] (#819)
        
        The *unordered* associative containers do not use default_*order*.
    
    commit aee45702ed8527b9dc74552a39c32fb6111a01c5
    Author: Jonathan Wakely <cxx@kayari.org>
    Date:   Sun Jul 10 17:58:14 2016 +0100
    
        [variant.swap] Use math mode for variable "i"

    Author: S. B. Tam <cpplearner@outlook.com>
    Date:   Sun Jul 10 17:50:36 2016 +0800
    
        [ﬁlesystems] Fix unmatched parentheses around references (#814)
    
    commit d3066bfac13e674fa53f1c332f7a4e4779b24fe7
    Author: Alisdair Meredith <public@alisdairm.net>
    Date:   Sun Jul 10 04:55:40 2016 +0100
    
        [19-26] Consistent use of _v (#783)
        
        The library clauses have started to make inconsistent use of the _v
        variable templates for traits, in preference to directly querying
        trait::value.  This change set applies that change consistently over
        all existing wording, where there is a choice of which form might
        be used.  It does not make any changes where the _v variable is not
        available, or is being defined in terms of the corresponding ::value.

        [valarray.members] Fix up index entries for named valarray member functions (#808)
        
        The index currently lists the named member-functions of valarray as
        if they were free functions - this adds the corresponding entry under
        the valarray listing in the index, alongside the existing entries for
        the many operator functions. It also fixes the entry for "size()".

        Also fix bad "smart" apostrophe in example.

        [strings,containers] Add iterators to index of implemenetation defined behavior (#754)
        
        This patch slavishly copies the tag used for array::iterator, without
        understanding if a better markup might be available.  One consequence
        is that we get two entries for basic_string_view::const_iterator.
        Another is that the index around type names appears as two sorted
        subsequences, rather than one sorted sequence.
        
        An additional patch will follow for the remaining implementation-defined
        types that are not present in the index, once the preferred markup is
        reviewed in this pull request.

        [18-20,27] Prefer to use 'override' where appropriate (#753)
        
        This patch makes consistent use of the 'override' contextual
        keyword for every member function (other than destructors)
        that overrides a virtual function in one of its base classes.
        
        In general, this came down to one of three cases:
        1) the 'what' function for an exception class
        2) the allocation functions of a memory resource
        3) the implementation methods of a stream buffer.
        
        As far as I can tell, all other virtual function declarations
        in the standard library are intended as customization points
        for users, and are not overridden in the standard itself.
        
        Fixes #751

        This PR applies the change recommended by https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/629.
        
        So far, I like the change giving the descriptions more room to
        breathe, but for come reason the first column has become a
        little narrower, which is messing with the format a little.
        
        Generally, I think this looks like a good fix, but may use a
        little more polish to get the presentation just right.

        [18,20] Consistent indexing of simple exception types (#750)
        
        Appply a simple, consistent pattern to the index entries, including
        th index of implementation defined behaviors, for the library types
        that derive from std::exception.
        
        In some cases this means adding entries, in others removing extra
        nested implementation-defined entries that are redundant since the
        addition of the index of implementatio defined behaviors.
        
        A few cross-references were added or corrected as part of this
        process.
        
        Further work to make the presentation and specification of these
        types probably requires LWG issues.  In particular, bad_any_cast
        is woefully underspecified.

        [18-28] Fix index entry for constructors
        
        The preferred way to list constructors in the index is under the
        non-code font term 'constructor', but many classes retain old
        text that lists the constructor under the class name as the same
        class name, in a code font.  Worse, there are quite a few classes
        that have fallen into a hybrid approach, with both listings, which
        can be confusing. This change-set should catch every constructor
        indexed in the old style and consistently transform it to the new.
        
        One additional fix is that allocator_traits mis-indexed the static
        member functions 'construct' and 'destroy' as the plain-text
        constructor and destructor.  This patch correctly indexes them as
        their correct name, in a code-font.

        to <stdarg.h> as <staarg.h>.

        [18-27] Remove tcode from index entries
        
        Several old index entries use '\tcode' to force a code
        font on their sub-entry.  This is no longer necessary,
        as the LaTeX scripts produce the correct font for an
        '\idxcode' entry.  However, using '\tcode' inconsistently
        will produce duplicate entries, and entries that do not
        sort correctly.  This change set consistently applies
        '\idxcode' in preference to '\tcode' to eliminate the
        redundant and mis-sorted entries.

        [time.duration.comparisons] Fix index entry for duration operator<
        
        The index entry for 'operator<' of the 'duration' class template is
        associated with an unknown 'idxl' type, instead of 'durtation'.

        [string.view.comparison] Fix index for basic_string_view operators
        
        The first issue is that operator<< does not group in the index with
        other definitions for operator<<, which use an index key of
        operator\shl.
        
        The second issue is that operator<< was the only operator indexed
        under the 'basic_string_view' key, where the precedent fro basic_string
        and other types is that the free-function operators are still indexed
        under their respective class entry.

        [allocator.adaptor] consolidate memory utilities]
        
        This patch simply moves the scoped allocator clause to
        be adjacent to the other memory and allocator clauses
        for a more consistent sub-organization of clause 20.
        
        The patch looks pretty awful thanks to the diff
        algorithm treating it as a lot of interspersed edits,
        where in fact is way a single cut/paste for the bulk
        of the test (plus a second one-liner for the clause 20
        table of contents).

        [18-30] Replace typedefs with alias-declarations (#704)
        
        This set of changes replace (almost) all use of 'typedef' in the library
            with a type alias instead:
                typedef Original NewName;
             ->
                using NewName = Original;
        
            Attention was paid to retaining table-like formatting where present, which
            is worth reviewing in case I made idiosyncratic choices.
        
            Clause 29 [atomic] was specifically ignored, as there is a desire for the
            contained code to look as close to a C compatible header as possible.
