## Notable editorial changes

### CWG motion 14

Subclause structure and paragraph order of [dcl.attr.contracts] was reworked.
Several normatively-redundant statements were converted to notes or removed.

### CWG motion 15

Multiple papers moved at this meeting included suggested feature-test macros.
However, these were not presented as editing instructions, because we did not
have feature-test macros in the standard wording yet. After consultation with
CWG and LWG, the following feature test macros have been added in addition to
those listed in CWG motion 15 (all with value `201806L`):

 *  `__has_cpp_attribute(assert)`
 *  `__has_cpp_attribute(ensures)`
 *  `__has_cpp_attribute(expects)`
 *  `__cpp_explicit_bool`
 *  `__cpp_nontype_template_parameter_class`
 *  `__cpp_lib_atomic_ref`
 *  `__cpp_lib_bit_cast`
 *  `__cpp_lib_concepts`
 *  `__cpp_lib_constexpr_swap_algorithms`
 *  `__cpp_lib_list_remove_return_type`

### CWG motions 16 and 12

CWG motion 16 would have us change wording that was deleted by CWG motion 12.
The requested change in CWG motion 16 (from teletype "`explicit`" to body font "explicit")
was ignored.

### LWG motion 11: issue 2139

The underlying text has changed between the drafting of the resolution to this
issue and its application. We believe every requested edit has been applied;
however, an additional use of "user-defined type" has been added to
[namespace.std] that should likely also have been covered by this wording.
It has *not* been changed.

### LWG motions 13 and 23

These motions both introduce a `<bit>` header, but the organizational structure
suggested by motion 23 doesn't make sense for the functionality
added by motion 13.
The wording of motion 23 has been rearranged to fit into
the structure established by motion 13.

### LWG motions 16

Added the new `contains` member function for associative containers to the list
of member function templates that do not participate in overload resolution
unless the comparator is transparent, after consultation with LWG.

### LWG motions 19 and 21

LWG motion 19 adds a `shift_right` algorithm to `<algorithm>`
as a non-`constexpr` function template.

LWG motion 21 instructs that we mark
all non-parallel algorithms in `<algorithm>`
as `constexpr`.
Naturally, however,
its proposed wording change does not list the `shift_right` algorithm.
After consultation with LWG, `shift_right` has been marked `constexpr`
to satisfy the intent of LWG motion 21.

### LWG motion 27

Synopses for
`<ccomplex>`,
`<cstdalign>`,
`<cstdbool>`, and
`<ctgmath>`
were not removed;
instead, they have been repurposed as synopses for
`<complex.h>`,
`<stdalign.h>`,
`<stdbool.h>`, and
`<tgmath.h>`.
(The latter used to be defined in terms of the former,
but can no longer be specified in that way.)
Also introduced a synopsis for `<iso646.h>`.

### LWG motion 28

Clause labels shortened and simplified throughout.

The single-item clauses [concept.movable], [concept.copyable],
[concept.semiregular], and [concept.regular] have been merged into their
parent, [concepts.object].

The single-item clauses [concept.signed.int] and [concept.unsigned.int]
have been merged into their parent, [concept.integral].

Legacy concept names changed from *Cpp98Something* to *Cpp17Something*. Many of
these concepts did not exist in C++98 (which in any case was revoked and
replaced by C++03).

Reworked "uniform random bit generator" requirements to describe them in terms
of the `UniformRandomBitGenerator` concept.

Removed "there need be no subsumption relationship" wording that is already
implied by the core language rules for concepts.

### Editorial paper [P1076R1 "Clause reorganization"](http://wg21.likn/p1076r1)

The claue reorganization described in P1076R1 and discussed at the WG21
Rapperswil meeting has been applied to the working draft, with the following
modifications:

[class.copy] was left containing only two paragraphs of text, neither of which
had any normative impact. It has been removed.

The top-level subclauses of [algorithms] have been reordered to make the
description of the `<numeric>` header fit better into its structure.

Several paragraphs of [class] describing various properties of classes have
been moved into a new subclause [class.prop] "Properties of clases".

### Removal of single-item subclauses

The single-item subclauses
[move.iter.op=] and
[move.iter.op.const]
have been merged into [move.iter.cons].

The single-item subclauses
[move.iter.op.star],
[move.iter.op.ref], and
[move.iter.op.index]
have been merged into [move.iter.elem].

The single-item subclauses
[move.iter.op.+],
[move.iter.op.-],
[move.iter.op.incr],
[move.iter.op.+=],
[move.iter.op.decr], and
[move.iter.op.-=]
have been merged into [move.iter.nav].

The now-empty [move.iter.ops] has been removed.

        [span.overview] Fix reverse_iterator for span (#2112)
        
        There is a common convention to omit 'std::' when not strictly needed,
        other than for 'std::move' and 'std::forward'.  A third case is for
        'reverse_iterator' and 'const_reverse_iterator' type aliases inside a
        class definition, as the leading 'reverse_iterator' type alias hides
        the 'std' version from the 'const_reverse_iterator' definition, and
        subsequently fails to compile.  This patch restore the class definition
        to a safely copy/pastable state.
        
        An additional review indicated this convention has been applied correctly
        for every othert potential occurrence in the library.

        [depr.c.headers] Undo P0619R4's removal of synopses for <ccomplex>,
        <cstdalign>, <cstdbool>, and <ctgmath>.
        
        Instead, repurpose these to be synopses for <complex.h>, <stdalign.h>,
        <stdbool.h>, and <tgmath.h>, and move them into [depr.c.headers].
        Also introduce a synopsis for <iso646.h>.
        
        This avoids three of these five headers being specified as equivalent to
        a non-existent <cfoo> header, and the other two missing a synopsis.

        [diff.cpp17.except] Add a note that there is no longer a way to write
        code that is non-throwing in both C++20 and C++03.

        [diff.cpp03.language.support] Remove change described in p1, which is no
        longer a possible change.
        
        It is not possible to write a global replacement operator new or
        operator delete in C++20 with code that is also valid C++03, because
        
        a) operator new must be declared 'throw(std::bad_alloc)' in C++03 and
           must be declared with no exception specification in C++11 onwards,
        and
        b) operator delete must be declared 'throw()' in C++03 and must be
           declared 'noexcept' in C++20 onwards.
        
        Therefore there is no code that is valid in C++03 and C++20 and changes
        meaning due to the change identified in this section.
        
        Instead, expand [diff.cpp03.language.support]p2 to explain that the
        affected programs are simply not valid in C++20.

        This note is only correct due to subtleties of later wording

        template). Correcting it results in it simply duplicating existing
        normative rules and not adding anything. So remove it instead.
