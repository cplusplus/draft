## Acknowledgements

Very special thanks to Dawn Perchik, who performed nearly all the edits for
motions moved at Lenexa (any errors are mine).

Thanks to all those who have [submitted editorial
issues](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/wiki/How-to-submit-an-editorial-issue)
and those who have provided pull requests with fixes.

## New Papers

 * N4527 is the current working draft. It replaces N4431.
 * N4528 is this Editor's Report for the current working draft.

### Notable Changes to Issues and Papers as Moved

#### LWG motion 16

Subclause
[thread.sharedtimedmutex.requirements], "Shared timed mutex types",
remains nested directly under
[thread.mutex.requirements], "Mutex requirements",
rather than being made a subclause of
[thread.sharedmutex.requirements], "Shared mutex types".
This is consistent with the existing treatment of the sibling
subclauses "Mutex types" and "Timed mutex types".

### Other Notable Editorial Changes:

No major editorial changes have been made since N4431.

## Minor Editorial Fixes

A log of all editorial fixes made since N4431 is below:

        [dcl.spec.auto] Deduction of auto in direct-list-initialization from a
        double-braced init list will always fail. Use a more specific term here

        Punctuation following canonical type strings, such as "pointer to int",
        go outside the quotation marks, because the quotation marks are part of
        the technical content. Punctuation stays inside other quotation marks.

    Author: Aaron Jacobs <aaronjjacobs@gmail.com>
    Date:   Thu Sep 18 13:36:12 2014 +1000
  
        [unord.req] Made intro wording for Table 103 more consistent.
        
        Both internally (it was inconsistent in "value" vs. "object") and externally
        (Tables 100 and 102 use "value"). While I was at it, fixed capitalization of
        the word "table" and fixed up TeX formatting.
  
    commit 9416ba8a051ef247c9b865edbb7b4ecd8771e7b8
    Author: Aaron Jacobs <aaronjjacobs@gmail.com>
    Date:   Thu Sep 18 13:30:30 2014 +1000
  
        [associative.reqmts] Made Table 102 consistent in the use of u.
        
        In other tables of requirements, the identifier 'u' is used for
        variables being declared. Made that the case here, too.
  
    commit 32279827a46305adb2219cc1317b491818f2978b
    Author: Aaron Jacobs <aaronjjacobs@gmail.com>
    Date:   Thu Sep 18 13:27:20 2014 +1000
  
         [sequence.reqmts] Made Table 100 consistent in the use of u.
        
        In other tables of requirements, the identifier 'u' is used for
        variables being declared. Made that the case here, too.
  
    commit 79f8b319b0bcecefaf47c13807b68f2b085f18ef
    Author: Aaron Jacobs <aaronjjacobs@gmail.com>
    Date:   Thu Sep 18 13:17:56 2014 +1000
  
        [allocator.requirements] Made Tables 27/28 consistent in the use of u.
        
        In other tables of requirements, the identifier 'u' is used for
        variables being declared. Made that the case here, too. This
        necessitated a reflow of other variable names.
  
    commit 9f9d2e712ce5b99034e2b24a5bebe7c25aeecbfd
    Author: Aaron Jacobs <aaronjjacobs@gmail.com>

    Date:   Thu Sep 18 11:35:01 2014 +1000
  
        [allocator.requirements] Fixed types for a, a1, a2 in Table 27.
        
        It doesn't make sense to re-use values of type X& when declaring a new
        X, as in the use of these variables in Table 28.
  
    commit f0fba72c0d49e855f5615bc2c0d387dae14fcfa6

    Date:   Sun Mar 22 21:05:36 2015 +0000
  
        Consistency cleanups in [containers] (cf. Issue #400). This part of the cleanup changes only whitespace: inserted before commas, removed after namespace braces, improved indentation consistency, removed some extraneous linebreaks for things that fit well on one line
  
    commit 284772e40896fe702dbec79477af2735624565fe
    Author: cpplearner <cpplearner@outlook.com>

        N4140 23.6.4.4 [priqueue.special] says "template <class T, class Container, Compare>". It should say "template <class T, class Container, class Compare>".
  
    commit 0eff4c29bd0655dbe13ac5acf3411060803da69e
    Author: Kazutoshi SATODA <k_satoda@f2.dion.ne.jp>
    Date:   Sat Aug 2 19:40:22 2014 +0900
  
        Make the note for both two conditions, not for just the latter of two
        
        as the note says "Under these conditions...".
        
        This changes numbering of the items in the note from "(4.2.1) ..." to
        "(4.3) ...".
