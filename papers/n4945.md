## New papers

 * [N4944](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4944.pdf) is the
   current working draft for C++23. It replaces
   [N4928](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4928.pdf).
 * N4945 is this Editors' Report.

## National body comments on the Committee Draft

N4919 is the C++23 Committee Draft. It received 137 comments from national bodies.
The first set of responses to all 11 editorial comments and to 49 non-editorial comments
was incorporated into the previous working draft, N4928; see the
[previous Editors' Report](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4929.html)
for details. The present working draft contains the final set of responses,
to 26 non-editorial comments, as noted below.

## Motions incorporated into working draft

### Notes on motions

* CWG Poll 7 does not modify the C++ Working Paper.
* For CWG Poll 4, the proposed wording of [CWG 2521](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2796r0.html#2521)
  erroneously used the non-existing grammar production *pp-token*,
  which was fixed to *preprocessing-token*.
* For CWG Poll 8, a change of "character classes" to "character properties"
  missing from [P2736R2](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2736r2.pdf)
  was applied.
* CWG Poll 8, LWG Polls 9 and 11 all affect Unicode-related wording. While the
  wording for the latter two was given relative to the status quo ante, the
  actual wording has been adjusted to incorporate the changes from the CWG poll.
  Moreover, we now always use the phrase "UAX #N of the Unicode Standard".
* For LWG Poll 2, issue [LWG 3821](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2789r0.html#3821),
  the new overload was marked as "freestanding" to match the surrounding interface;
  this was not in the proposed wording.
* For LWG Poll 6, an unused and erroneous default argument "`pos = 0`" was removed.
* For LWG Poll 16, the wording has been reconciled with the changes from issue
  [LWG 3775](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2703r0.html#3775)
  that was applied after the previous meeting.

### Noteworthy editorial changes

* In the container requirements, the presentation of "contiguous container" has
  been reordered for a better logical progression, which was made possible by
  the earlier dissolution of the requirements tables.

        This change was missed from the application of CWG2518.

        Also fixes the indexing of "static_assert" (which is a keyword, not a
        grammar production).

        [cpp.pre] Fix grammar for #elifdef

        This fix is editorial as it corrects a mis-application of the original
        paper, https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2334r1.pdf.

        Note that the corresponding use of this grammar in [cpp.cond]p13
        assumes the correct grammar, making the intent equally clear.

        [expr.prim.req.compound] Move compound requirement example from inner to outer bullet (#6159)

        Example 1 from [expr.prim.req.compound] is currently attached to the
        inner bullet point, but should be attached to the outer one.

        [util.smartptr.atomic.general] Simplify example code (#6077)

        Removes the redundant explicit construction of the return value,
        and uses an explicit return type instead of "auto" for clarity.

        [range.split] Fix invalid conversion in example (#6041)

        Replaces an illegal implicit conversion from a range to string_view
        in the example with an explicit one.

        After P2499R0, it is no longer possible to implicitly construct a
        string_view from a range (like the ones produced by views::split).

        [span.iterators] Fix cross-reference to container iterators (#6183)

        The current cross-reference is to [containers.requirements], which
        is the whole containers requirements clause, including not just
        general containers, but also allocator-aware, reversible, sequence,
        associative, and unodered associative containers.  It seems very
        unlikely that the cross-reference expects to be the intersection
        of all of those.

        Rather, the reference seems to intend just the [containers.reqmts]
        subclause, which adds just two useful constraints: random access
        iterators should support the 3-way comparison operator, and the
        interoperabiity of container iterators and const_iterators.

        [container.reqmts] Fix cross-references to contiguous container

        This edit deserves describing in detail, to establish that it
        is purely editorial.

        As part of the mission to clean up tables in the standard,
        the general container requirements were split into 5 more
        focused leaf nodes.  Due to its location in the original
        text, the definition for a contiguous container fell into
        the subclause for reversible containers, to which it is
        entirely unrelated.  There is no requirement that a
        contiguous container be reversible, only that it has the
        correct category for its iterators.

        Meanwhile, all 3 of the existing cross-references point
        to the wrong leaf node, that simply provides a key to
        the identifiers used throughout the specification of this
        clause.

        The fix has two parts.  First move the definition of
        contiguous container, and a container with special
        iterators, into the [container.reqmts] clause where it
        best belongs.  This move is appended to the end so that
        there can be no ambiguity that any existing text could
        be confused with requirements only on contiguous
        containers after the edit.  The other part is to fix up
        the three cross-references to point to [container.reqmts]
        rather than its sibling that has no information on
        contiguous containers.

        A grep of the .tex source files confirms that these
        three references (array,basic_string, and vector) are
        the only current uses of contiguous container, even
        though basic_stacktrace would also meet the requirements.
