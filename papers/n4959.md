## Acknowledgements

Thanks to all those who have [submitted editorial
issues](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/wiki/How-to-submit-an-editorial-issue)
and to those who have provided pull requests with fixes,
and special thanks to Johel Ernesto Guerrero Peña for providing in-depth review
of many of the draft motion applications.

## New papers

 * [N4958](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4958.pdf) is the
   current working draft for C++26. It replaces
   [N4950](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4950.pdf).
 * N4959 is this Editors' Report.

## Motions incorporated into working draft

### Notes on motions

All motions were applied cleanly. In a small number of cases, the approved
wording was based on an older draft and needed reconciliation with intervening
changes, but it was clear how to do this.

* The wording for [P1854R4](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p1854r4.pdf)
  ("Making non-encodable string literals ill-formed", CWG Poll 3)
  has been reconciled with previous changes from
  [P2314R4](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2314r4.html)
  ("Character sets and encodings").
* For [P0792R14](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p0792r14.html)
  ("`function_ref`: a type-erased callable reference", LWG Poll 18),
  among some minor fixes for correctness and consistency,
  exposition-only members have been added explicitly to the class synopsis,
  which had only been mentioned in the descriptive text in the approved wording.
* The feature test macro `__cpp_lib_format` has been modified three times, as follows:
  * `202304L` by
    [P2510R3](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2510r3.pdf)
    ("Formatting pointers", LWG Poll 10)
  * `202305L` by
    [P2757R3](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2757r3.html)
    ("Type checking format args", LWG Poll 20)
  * `202306L` by
    [P2637R3](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2637r3.html)
    ("Member `visit`", LWG Poll 21)
* The feature test macro for
  [P2641R4](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2641r4.html)
  ("Checking if a union alternative is active", LWG Poll 22)
  has been renamed from `__cpp_lib_within_lifetime` to `__cpp_lib_is_within_lifetime`,
  which seems more appropriate and follows existing practice.
* For [P2630R4](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2630r4.html)
  (`submdspan`, LWG Poll 29), numerous minor editorial corrections and improvements
  have been applied; see the full commit log for details.

## Editorial changes

### Noteworthy changes

Some Unicode examples of the new formatting facilities had been missing from the
last few working drafts (but are present in the C++23 DIS) because they needed
some bespoke handling. This has now been integrated into the main branch, and
the examples now appear correctly in the working draft. (The examples are
generated with LuaTeX. As a side effect, the typeface used in existing diagrams
has been changed to match the one used for the main body text. We have also
explored switching the typesetting engine for the main document from eTeX to
LuaTeX. This is possible in principle, but results in slightly lower typographic
quality at the moment, so we are holding off on this and will revisit this
change in the future.)

The title of the working draft has been changed to "Working Draft, Programming
Languages — C++", to match the official title of the standard more closely.

### Minor editorial changes

A log of editorial fixes made to the working draft since N4950 is below. This
list excludes changes that do not affect the body text or only affect whitespace
or typeface. For a complete list including such changes (or for the actual
deltas applied by these changes), consult the [draft sources on
github](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/compare/n4950...n4958).

        [strings], [unord.req.general], [stringbuf.members]: Fix xrefs to [container.requirements.general]

        All the references for "qualifies as an input iterator" and "qualifies
        as an allocator" are supposed to be to [container.reqmts] p69 which
        begins:

        > The behavior of certain container member functions and deduction
        > guides depends on whether types qualify as input iterators or
        > allocators.

        The reference in [string.require] for obtaining an allocator should be
        to [container.reqmts] p64.

        The reference in [string.require] Note 2 should be to
        [container.requirements.pre] p3.

        [flat.{,multi}{map,set}.cons]: zip_view should be views::zip (#6373)

        We don't expect to use CTAD on `ranges::zip_view(args...)`;
        what we expect is `views::zip`.
