## Notable editorial changes

### CWG motion 11 and CWG motion 10

Rebased `char8_t` wording on the revised description of fundamental types
introduced by CWG motion 10. The description of `unsigned char` as the
underlying type of `char8_t` now renders unnecessary some of the other
wording in CWG motion 11; such wording has consequently not been applied.

### CWG motion 14

After consulting with CWG, added the missing definition for "usable in constant
expressions" as applied to objects and references.

### CWG motion 15

Removed now-unused grammar production *default-template-argument*.

### CWG motion 15 and CWG motion 4

CWG motion 4 adds new uses of the grammar production *qualified-concept-name*
that CWG motion 15 removes. These have been updated to instead refer to the
new production *type-constraint*, and the normative wording of CWG motion 4
has been rewritten to use the new term "immediately-declared constraint",
both of which were introduced by CWG motion 15.

### LWG motion 11

Change 10 included an editing instruction to make matching changes elsewhere
in the draft. There does not appear to be any "elsewhere" to make said changes.
This editing instruction was ignored.

### LWG motion 13 and LWG motion 26

The specification of `bind_front` was simplified by replacing *DECAY_UNWRAP*
a use of the new `unwrap_ref_decay_t` alias template introduced by LWG motion 13.

### LWG motion 25

The wording paper contained an unmarked modification of [std.iterator.tags],
replacing "the most specific category tag" with "a category tag".
After consulting with the paper authors, the change was intentional, and
the corresponding edit has been applied despite not being marked up.

### LWG motion 25 and CWG motion 4

CWG motion 4 removes a grammar production from *requires-clause*s, but
LWG motion 25 adds new uses of said grammar production. Those uses are all
of the form

```
requires {
  { expr } -> Same<T>&;
}
```

After consultation with LWG, these uses have been rewritten as

```
requires {
  { expr } -> Same<T&>;
}
```

which is believed to both correctly reflect the intent and not change the
meaning in practice of any of the uses introduced by LWG motion 25.

Additionally, CWG motion 4 contains an instruction to replace all constructs
of the form

```
requires {
  E; requires Concept<decltype((E)), Args>;
}
```

with the simpler (but now equivalent)

```
requires {
  { E } -> Concept<Args>;
}
```

throughout [concepts]. However, LWG motion 25 adds many more instances of
the former pattern throughout several other clauses. All such instances
throughout the working draft have been replaced.

### LWG motion 26

A feature test macro name `__cpp_lib_bind_front` was recommended by the paper,
but no wording changes were included to add said feature test macro to the
working draft's table of feature test macros. The macro has been added to
the table anyway.

### Section label changes

Several section labels introduced by the motions papers have been modified
to match our style guide. In addition to the section labels affected by the
above motions, the following changes have been made:

[string.op+=] has been renamed to [string.op.append].  
[string.op+] has been renamed to [string.op.plus].

[re.regex.nmswap] was the only subclause in its parent [re.regex.nonmemb].
The former heading has been removed, leaving the old content directly in
[re.regex.nonmemb].

          didn't fit well here.
        - "the object" -> "the object to which the glvalue refers"
          Make it clear what "the object" refers to.

        [conv.lval] Improve the note about std::nullptr_t case
        
        The meaning of "fetched from memory" is vague, and the two uses of term
        "access" [defns.access] are inappropreate here because
          - it causes undefined behavior to access an inactive member of a
            union, based on the rule of out-of-lifetime object [basic.life]:
            > The program has undefined behavior if:
            >   - the glvalue is used to access the object, or
          - it implies reading the referenced object of std::nullptr_t,
            which is defined to be a side effect for volatile-qualified case.
            [intro.execution]
            > Reading an object designated by a volatile glvalue, ... are all
            > side effects, ...
